    "a": "a bigger issue with this isn't going to be the tidal locking of a moon to a planet, it will be the orbit that the moon takes while having the planet between itself and the sun. a planet eclipse, if you will. depending on how long the moon is behind the planet will give how much the temperature will drop.\n\nanother issue to think about is the protection from radiation. will the planet take care of that or will the moon have to do this for itself? radiation levels in space are nuts.\n\nthen there is the tilt (which you mentioned) that can give seasons, but also keep in mind that the orbits of the planets are rarely circular, tending to usually be an ellipse. this gives even more temperature differential.\n\nthe tidal locking of a moon to a planet can affect things but as long as the above is good, the tidal lock shouldn't be much of an issue. the big hangup, like I stated previously, is the length of the orbit while behind the planet.",

    "q": "ELI5: Why is Xbox disliked so much?",
    "a": "It isn't.  The XBox series of consoles are perfectly viable gaming consoles.  They lost a large chunk of the market share because Microsoft mismanaged the product line after the XBox 360.  They viewed the XBox One as a full-on entertainment system instead of a gaming console, and it actually does quite well with that (I haven't played a game on my XBox in five years, but it's still hooked up to my TV and gets used daily).  Before the age of the Smart TV, XBox Ones served as an all-access set-top box where you got your streaming services, could integrate your cable channels, control your surround sound, etc.  Toss a Kinect in there and you could do it all via voice commands that essentially turned your XBox into a universal remote.  You could even use a web browser, read your email, etc.\n\nUnfortunately for Microsoft, console users didn't give a damn about that, they wanted their consoles to play games, and that's where Sony excelled.  They learned from the mistakes of the PS3 and curated the gaming market with some rather fantastic exclusive titles (Microsoft had that, too, but there weren't anywhere near as good at it as Sony).  Sure, the PS4 had the apps built in, as well, but that wasn't Sony's focus.  They knew their market better than Microsoft did (Microsoft is *still* struggling with this).\n\nThat and Microsoft *really* shot themselves in the foot with their online-only requirement.  When they first announced that they weren't going to allow it to play even single-player games without an internet connection, the gaming comminity lost their minds.  What *really* hurt them was when 100,000 Sailors and Marines stood up and said, \"you mean to tell us we can't take our Xbox's onto a ship and play video games on them in our free time while floating aorund the world's oceans?\"  And then 200,000 Army dudes stood up and said, \"hey, motherfuckers, we're still in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we *can't* hook our consoles up to what little internet access we have!  You mean to tell us we can't play your video games when we aren't dodging rockets?\"\n\nThey never quite recovered from that PR disaster.",

    "a": "It's a scale problem, for one thing. You'd need more lightning rods than we really have the capcity to build, because you have to build a tower and grounding equipment for each one. A lightning rod really only provides protection in a radius of about 30m (about 2800 m\\^2).\n\nThere are over 3million square km of forest in the US alone. That's 3,300,000,000,000 square meters. You'd need over a billion lightning rods.\n\nAnd even then, you wouldn't prevent forest fires. The western half of North America is pretty dry, and it's FULL of biomes that rely on regular small fires to maintain the ecology. We've spent 100+ years preventing fires and allowing fuel buildup through crappy management practices, so now, by July or August every year, half the continent is basically a powder keg. The lightning just happens to be the match, but once it gets to a certain point, practically anything can start a fire. If it wasn't lightning strikes, it'd be something else.",

    "a": "There are two types of carbon: C12 and C14. C14 is unstable and spontaneously decays into C12 at a known rate. C14 is also created in the upper atmosphere through interactions with cosmic rats at a known rate. These two rates are roughly the same so the amount of C14 in the air stays roughly the same.\n\nThe carbon in your body is made from the carbon in the air (indirectly). So the percentage of C12 vs C14 in your body is the same as that in the air - so long as you are alive.\n\nWhen you die, you stop taking in new sources of carbon so the C14 in your body will decay into C12 (at the known rate) without being replenished.\n\nSince the decay rate and C12:C14 ratios are known, we can measure the C14 in the remains of a once living organisms and determine how long it has been since it replenished its C14 (e.g how long it has been since it was alive.)",

    "q": "ELI5: what is audio sample rate?",
    "a": "Already some good answers on this, but it's also important to understand the effects of different settings on these options.\n\nSampling rate is how often the audio signal is sampled. The rate you choose here will determine the highest frequency that your audio system can reproduce. Whatever rate you choose, your system will be limited in frequency to half that rate. So, if your sampling rate is 44.1k, the highest frequency it can reproduce is 22.05k. If sampling rate is 96k, then highest frequency is 48k, etc. Luckily, humans can't hear over 20k, so most common sampling rate are ok. However, sometimes you'll encounter weird sampling rates, like in digital telephone systems you might see 16k or 8k sampling rate. That's generally ok because we're used to telephone audio sounding pretty bad. Analog telephones don't transmit much of anything above 3k.\n\nBit depth refers to how many \"steps\" you have to choose from between the lowest and highest voltage representing the audio wave. A lot of people think of this or describe it as the \"resolution\" of the sound, but in reality what this setting determines is how much noise your system will introduce into the sound. Technically it's called quantization noise. If you constrained a sound to 4 bits, you'd hear tons of crazy noise. At 16 bit, noise is generally inaudible unless you really are pumping up the sound a lot (like playing it into a basketball arena at full volume, but even then, the crowd noise would drown out any tiny amounts of noise). At 24+ bits, noise is extremely low.\n\nA sampling rate of 44.1k or 48k and a bit depth of 16 bits is generally sufficient for the vast majority of listening environments. Higher settings are often used in pre- and post-production environments, recording studios, and professional broadcast or live sound applications, for good reason. While audio is being processed over and over again, it's better to use higher settings. But for a typical listening environment, lower settings are totally fine.",

Meanwhile, medicine is also getting more advanced and more widely available, so of course lifespan is also going to increase. I do agree with you at least on one note, this likely does not imply any causation. It is simply correlation. I would imagine on a shorter scale, say, over 1 generation of people, we would expect an inverse correlation similar to what you suggest, but I can't find any data to support that.

    "a": "Most were built in the era. There was a vogue for 'revival styles' in the late 19th century, but those aren't entirely true to the originals and are labeled \"revival\" styles (Gothic Revival, Renaissance Revival, Baroque Revival, sometimes with the prefix \"Neo-\" instead of \"Revival\") and of course there are some modern ones. \n\nWhen you're talking about a town of medieval (or later) origins like Prague, then the Baroque period isn't even _that_ old. (17th-mid 18th century) There are likely a lot of buildings there with baroque-era facades which are built on medieval foundations. \n\nReally old building were often built and extended and renovated in stages. Walk into a gothic cathedral and there's some medieval bits, some baroque bits, some renaissance bits, and you know it's 'real'. If it's all perfectly, flawlessly gothic throughout, then it's either new or was heavily \"restored\" in the 19th century (when 'restoration' often meant restoring it to a kind of idealized version of the structure that'd never existed, e.g. Viollet le Duc's restoration of Notre Dame in Paris)  \n\nOld styles went out of style. Baroque went out of style in the late 18th century so hard that the word is [still a pejorative](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/baroque#English) to this day for something needlessly complicated. So it's not like former generations had more respect than we would for a brutalist concrete building from the 1960s.\n\nMost 'old' buildings in European cities are not _that_ old, but date to the decades around the turn of the former century (roughly 1880-1920). Because that was an era of heavy urbanization and city growth, combined with industrialization that made it economical to build big apartment buildings and ornate styles that (as said) were influenced by history. After WWI historical styles went out of fashion, first in favor of less-ornate styles like Art Deco and then modernist ones. So you wouldn't necessarily think that the medieval-esque [Stockholm City Hall](https://i.redd.it/9407dq86d1z81.jpg) is only built 15 years before [Villa Savoye](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3c/VillaSavoye.jpg), but it's true. (and the latter was very much a reaction to the perceived excesses of the former styles)\n\nSo the most common 'old' building you'd find around a city like Paris or Prague would be about 100-140 years old. And are in a sense the newest old buildings, as they're nowhere near as old as the oldest old buildings.",

From the reservoir, it’s pumped through a centrifugal or roller pump to a membrane oxygenator, which exchanges gas like your lungs would do, and then pumped to the aortic cannula and out to the body.

    "a": "\"Statistically significant\" is a useful term which is widely used in scientific publications (it's certainly not banned, lol).\n\nThe term \"statistically significant\", has a very specific meaning, and not everyone correctly understands its meaning. Statistical significance is a measure of how extreme your results would be, if the null hypothesis was true. \n\nLet's say that you have invented a new fertilizer, and have a hypothesis that exposure to your new fertilizer makes grass grow faster. You do an experiment where you have 1000 patches of grass, and you add fertiliser to 500 of them, and leave the other 500 without fertilizer.\n\nYou measure how much the grass grows in each patch. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in how much the grass grows.\n\nYour results are: unfertilized grass: 20 mm +/- sd. 5 mm.  Fertilized grass: 21 mm +/- 5mm. \n\nYou do an unpaired t-test, and get a result p= 0.0016. This is an extremely statistically significant result. This means that this result is extremely unlikely to have occurred if your fertilizer did nothing. In other words, it is highly likely that your fertilizer works (This is statistical significance). \n\nBut look at the actual results. The unfertilized grass grew on average 20 mm, and the fertilized grass grew 21 mm. The effect is tiny, and the effect of the fertilizer is completely swamped by the effects of soil and other stuff. The standard deviation of 5 mm, means that there would probably be 5 fertilized patches which grew 6 mm or less, and 5 unfertilized patches which grew 35 mm or more.\n\nWhat farmer would buy your fertilizer? None. It's pretty much useless. The effect it has is so tiny, that it is basically irrelevant. (This is scientific significance).",

This includes controlling access to the data on other webpages you have open (e.g. each tab/window is in its own sandbox). At least in theory.\n\nAt some point, there was a push to encrypt things on the web. To use HTTPS instead of HTTP. This basically means two things:\n- the server is verified as being the correct host for the website domain\n- the data sent between the server and you or vice versa is encrypted\nThis is pretty important if the server is sending you secure info or you're sending it important stuff (e.g. your password or credit card number).\n\nBut! What if there was insecure content linked on the website? E.g. an image. Well, a crafty attacker could try and intercept that connection with a malicious payload. Your browser would put that in the same sandbox I mentioned above as the rest of the page, and once inside it could read that secure data and send it back to the attack.\n\nSo browsers enforce an all or nothing approach. If a webpage is served over HTTPS all its content must also be served over HTTPS. Nowadays browsers also prevent you from putting password or credit card details into non HTTPS websites at all and search engines deprioritise them, so everyone should use HTTPs.",

Otherwise, the company is trying to get investors to buy into their business - which is the entire point of Shark Tank.\n\nThe reason why these pitches aren't given straight to big brands like Nike is that the owner wants to maintain ownership of the company. Nike will offer to buy the patent outright (which is far less value that what the owner sees in the long term) or make their own version in-house and not have to pay a license fee.",

    "a": "Even beyond the idea of the human eyes supposedly being capped at 60 FPS you also have to keep in mind that there's more to gaming than just the screen refreshing. A really good gaming mouse can have a response time of 5 milliseconds (or 1/200th of a second), which then has to show up on your screen. So if the screen is only updating every 60th of a second you can have a situation where if you move your mouse right after your screen refreshes, your 1/200th of a second response time of a mouse now has to wait for a full 60th of a second to show up on your screen, meaning it's not a true 5 millisecond response time but now it's actually about 17 milliseconds from time you move the mouse to the time it shows on your screen.\n\nSo increasing the framerate can help ensure that there is never a super long gap between when a movement is registered and when it actually appears on the screen which is really important for gaming.

Poverty, insecurity, abuse, PTSD, and thr like are taught to the next generation, even if unconsciously.   However, it ABSOLUTLEY can be genetic........well, sort of.  Epi-genetic.\n\nOur genetic code contains a blueprint for the expression of heritage traits;  everything from eye color to the types of cellular membrane receptor proteins we produce.  HOWEVER, our genes carry LOTS of sets of instructions, and part of what we inherit, along with simple base pair sequences coding for proteins, are break (where coding starts and stops), and switches that turn genes on and off or up and down (meaning whether they are fully or partially expressed.) \n\nRecent science STRONGLY demonstrates that that second set of instructions can be easily affected by environment, including exposure to chemicals and stressors.  This changes, NOT the DNA itself, but how, how much,and sometimes whether it is expressed. This can lead to physiological, psychological, and disease-profile changes that last for generations.  \n\nExample 1:  Norway has very low rates of obesity and diabetes, except in one area where several villages were occupied by the Nazis during WWII.  The people in those villages were starved for nearly four years, and many died.  People who were young adults or teenagers during this time of prolonged starvation went on to have CHILDREN and GRANDCHILDREN plagued by diabetes and obesity at rates over 1000%   higher than the rest of Norway.  There is nothing appreciably different GENETICALLY about those people, but anti-starvation genes have been switched on, that were switched off. \n\nExample 2.  When pregnant rats were exposed to normally pleasant smells, like vanilla, bananas, etc, but were then given severe electric shocks in combination with those smells, predictably they became afraid of the smell.  However, their immediate OFFSPRING and for three generations after that, the babies were afraid of, and avoided those smells. \n\nSo, the term is \"epi-genetics\", and it is definitely changing views on heritabilitu and evolution, but also about where behavior comes from.   Here is a lecture from a leading researcher who can explain how it happens better than I could. \n\n\n https://youtu.be/b3IOUmT8YIE",

If there is enough, the matter gets very fast and violent, it wants to get its space asap.\n\nNow, gas particles are super snobish (i mean some call themselves 'noble' 🙄) they like a *lot* of space, so when a lot of gas is in a small place it tries to spread out, and much more quickly then other matter. That is also why baloons burst. One thing to cause an explosion is a lot of gas in one place, especially if it becomes a gas because of the chemical reaction (coal is pretty dense. Smoke gas, much less) they violently rip out.\n\nAlso, if a lot of energy is released, (if you remember exo/endothermic reactions) it either speeds a lot of matter in one direction (kinetic energy) or every particle in random direction (thermal energy). Either way, if you give angry people running in attempt to just get away ASAP steroids and motorcycles, obviously its only going to get more violent.\n\nAnd that is why lithium + water explode, since exploding is just expanding very very quickly (doesnt have to be due to combustion)",

An employee getting fired for a bad reason and leaving the business a bad public review detailing the situation is dignified.  \n\n\n\"Get away with dignity\" is a phrase that means more of \"I will escape from this bad situation with my morals/reputation intact.\" If you work for a company and discover the business owner is a criminal: If you keep working there, that is undignified to some (you knew and did nothing) and neither dignified/undignified to others (you need a job). If you leave after discovering this, you are getting away with your dignity intact. You can definitively point to the fact that you left the moment you discovered the bad association in order to preserve your dignity.",

    "q": "ELI5: But if men are stronger, They don't have to carry a pregnancy to term to have children and are more favorites in our society so why do men live less than women?",
    "a": "First of all, men are actually born slightly less often then women to start with. Second, civilization tends to rely a great deal on war, generally men are better at fighting war, as such our civilizations tended to favor them. This has had a lasting legacy (though there are exceptions and before civilization it was often women who were in charge for reasons which may become obvious later.) Because of war men tend to die a lot more aften.\n\nMasculinity, while its spacifics vary from culture to culture, often include tendencies toward violence and dangerous behavior. Generally women don't experience that in femininity. Men thus challenge eachother, fight, hurt eachother or die/get hurt in accidents women don't have. This also includes a lot of unhealthy behavior like copious drinking, substance abuse, and bad habits &amp; diets leading to heart disease, diabetes, etc. Men tend to push those things further when they experience them. Men also tend to be less likely to seek help or health care.\n\nIt has always been true, before civilization, that men tended to hunt. Hunting was often dangerous and led to injuries. As does much of what I described above. As you pointed out in the question, injuries (like child birth) tend to increase the chances of complications and early death. \n\nMeanwhile, a great deal of medicine (and its predecessors) focused on birth. (Humans heads are basically too big for a woman's body, it's always been particularly hard for our species to deliver babies.) Because of this, medicine has often revolved around childbirth and its complications. Acceptance of medical intervention and oversight are sort of standard for women once they've been pregnant. This is stark when compared to men who tend to avoid health care.\n\nThere's probably a lot of biology too, but I'm not educated in that field.",

    "a": "Most grains are harvested using a [\"combine harvester\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combine_harvester#The_threshing_process), which works as follows:\n\n1) First, it cuts the seed heads off the crop and pulls them into the machine.  This is called \"reaping\".\n2) Then, it whacks the seed heads with a rotating metal smasher called a thresher, crushing them against a concave plate that has holes slightly larger than the grain.  This breaks up the seed heads into grain, straw (big stems and leaves), and chaff (small bits of stems and leaves the same size as grain.) Some of the grain and chaff falls through the holes to Step 4, but the straw -- and some grain and chaff -- gets pushed out of the thresher into Step 3.  This step is called \"threshing\".\n3) The remaining straw, grain and chaff passes over more metal plates with holes in them.  These plates vibrate in a way that encourages the seeds and chaff to fall through the holes to Step 4, and the straw to gradually progress toward the back of the combine where it's ejected.\n4) Now we're down to grain and chaff.  A powerful fan blows over this mix, blowing away the lightweight chaff and leaving the heavier grain behind.  This process is repeated several times until the grain is free of chaff.  The chaff is blown out the back of the machine, and the grain is collected in a tank.    This step is called \"winnowing\".\n\nYou asked about dirt and rocks and stuff: there's a rock trap near the front of the machine that keeps big rocks from getting into the machine, but for the most part, the operator knows to cut the crop high enough off the ground to keep dirt and gravel from getting in.",

    "a": "There's a teriffic [VSauce video](https://youtu.be/Xc4xYacTu-E) about this, which probably does a better job than I will.\n\nImagine two people walking along eachother. They start at the equator, heading north. Neither turns at any point, from their perspective it's a straight line. Their paths intersect at the north pole. Two straight parallel lines intersect, because the surface is curved.\n\nSpacetime is also curved.\n\nImagine a universe that has one dimension. It's just a straight line extending in front of you. It's pointing away from you, it stretches from around your chest to about half a meter, two feet ahead. There are two objects in that universe and they're moving about. Freeze it one second in and place that second ten cm, 4 inches to the right. Another second, another snapshot, another ten cm to the right. Rewind it to a second before the start, and place that to the left of the original universe. Keep doing this, get all these straight lines, and then connect them with the inbetweens; get a big ribbon going left and right; moving in time is moving left and right. The normal flow of time is going right at 10cm/s.\n\nLeft to their own devices, the objects in this universe would go in straight lines, right? Parallel lines left to right on the ribbon. But now imagine sort of inflating the ribbon. There's a big bubble in the middle now, our little spacetime ribbon all curved. Now when the objects try to move to the right, their parallel lines will intersect and the object will collide. Bump! They meet on our bubble.\n\nImagine being in that universe. You can't see the bubble. You're just cruising a long on one object, another object staying the same distance. Then suddenly you seem to accelerare towards each other. What mysterious force is this? None. You're just moving along because that's the march of time, and the world curved, and parallel lines became obsolete.\n\nThis is what gravity is. It's signifcantly harder to imagine what with the additional dimensions, but that's the principle. The march of time is of straight lines along the surface of spacetime, and spacetime is curved and straight lines meet. If we didn't walk along time, we wouldn't have lines - we'd just be dots, and dots don't bend. But we have trajectories, and they can bend and we can meet.",

If there is partial skin and hair left over, like with a mummified body, they use that to determine the skin and hair color overall.

    "a": "For plain Wifi, it goes like this:\n\nWhenever a device wants to send a message, it first listens for a bit.  If no other device is talking then it sends out its message.  But, if it hears another device talking, then it waits a random amount of time before trying again.  The random delay is important, because there may be multiple devices waiting to transmit.\n\nIf the device keeps hearing other devices transmit, it will increase its wait time window.  More devices wanting to speak means each may have to wait longer to get its turn.\n\nAdditionally, all messages are split up into pieces, and there is a mandatory delay in-between transmissions to allow other devices a turn.  So, no device's turn to transmit takes too long.\n\nWifi can work okay, even in moderately crowded environments, as long as all of the devices play by the rules.",

Darwin’s initial theory was very well founded, so efforts to disprove it or detract from it are generally not seen. But things like the discovery of DNA 100 years after Darwin published his original theory can add to it significantly. Evolution postulates how species develop, through natural selection. DNA adds to it by showing how natural selection actually happens - through small mutations in genetic code that either advance or detract from survival.\n\nDetraction works similarly. A theory can be fairly sound, but maybe some small details are not accurate. Like when Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet because its behavior significantly differs from other planets.\n\n\nOften times, you see older theories rejected outright. Like the miasma theory of illness, which was essentially that “bad air” caused sickness like Plague. Well, a few hundred years later, we discover bacteria and determine that bacteria caused Plague. And we also saw evidence that said bacteria was transmitted by fleas, not by air. Scientists rejected miasma theory and replaced it with Germ theory a few hundred years after the fact.\n\nBut some older theories can also be accepted as is, and further proven, like how many of Eintsteins theories have been proven as correct a hundred years after he conceives of them.",

You stick one of these tags/rings/badges/... on the person and every so often read it to find out how much radiation they have received.

You can measure the current radiation levels and guess about how the levels have changed and how long the person was exposed.  This guessing is better than giving up, but it's nothing like a measurement.\n\nDosimeters are inexpensive, and everybody who might be exposed should really have one.

This is not heat flow - the energy is mechanically extracted from the gas by the piston.

They are bold, and confident in the wild, often able to suspend hostilities for a mutual gain. For example they often hunt cooperatively in circumstances that benefits heavily from having teammates.\n\nYou can facilitate a similar relationship by essentially associating your presence with food, warmth, security etc, while doing everything you can to communicate that you do not pose a threat. \n\nOver time the animal will see you as a net benefit for survival, and come to seek out your presence and enjoy your company.\n\nHowever all this is pointless if the individual is particularly timid, aggressive, or suspicious, and no amount of work can change their natural disposition. One of my animals comes when he's called, can sit on command, and enjoys travelling outdoors with me on hikes, walks, and even trips to the grocery store. I also have a second individual that I put the same amount of work into, who if I tried to take on adventures or cuddle while watching a movie, would shred me like tissue paper and angrily stomp back to his hidey hole.\n\nWhat you see when people 'tame' wild animals, is simple. They provide resources for the animal, and the individual animal just happens to be docile enough to erect a truce between itself and its keeper. But make no mistake, this is not the same as a domestic animal that is bred for docility. They will immediately burn that truce to the ground if you overstep your bounds, or if you sufficiently frighten the animal. \n\nTl;DR\n\nAnimals have individual personalities, and almost any animal can be docile. Docile animals are willing to tolerate other animals that provide a benefit to their survival. If you are able to establish trust between yourself and said docile animal, you get a seemingly 'tame' wild animal. But it's still a wild animal, and lacks the centuries of docility bred into its genes, unlike a dog or a cow. This significantly increases the risk of the wild animal, well, going wild.",

In the US about 22% of electricity is created by burning coal, 38% natural gas, 19% nuclear, and 20% various renewables (wind, hydroelectric, solar, etc.). Right out the gate it means 39% of the sources of electricity aren't fossil fuels as opposed to 100% of gas-powered cars being fossil fuels.\n\nAnother major point is overall efficiency. An internal combustion engine is only about 40% efficient in turning the energy in its fuel into motion with the rest mostly going into waste heat. A fossil fuel fired power plant tends to be significantly more efficient at around 50% efficiency, and has much better emissions scrubbing systems because it doesn't need to carry them around in a vehicle. A car's electric motor is about 90% efficient in turning electricity into motion. Accounting for losses from transmission through the grid the efficiency gains are likely marginal, but it does matter *where* the emissions are produced.

    "a": "Everyone is able to access a site code, because it's not supposed to be hidden from the user. In fact, you have it literally there in your browser, available with 2 clicks. The problem is that it's minified, which is a process of shrinking it to the maximum, which makes it way less readable, so as a side effect, it's difficult to figure out, but it's doable, hard work, tho. And also a site code might get transformed e.g. if a page was coded in TypeScript, it's converted to JavaScript first and then also minified, so you cannot go back to TypeScript, because the browser never got it. That's just how it's built underneath.\n\nNo, salting is done on API side (server), not by the client (site, as you call it). I haven't worked on any project that salted password in the client.\n\nGetting the initial value from a hashed value is damn complex operation and based on a used algorithm, it might be closer to impossible aka too meany years required or too many resources to shrink the operaton to acceptable amount of time.\n\nI am not a hacker, but they look for any \"backdoors\" to the server, meaning how to execute a code, which they shouldn't be allowed to execute. So they can e.g. execute a piece of code to get the data from database, just like the server does the same, but it's allowed it. On the other hand, a server code is compiled, so it's not a readable code at all, it might be a bytecode language which the runtime environment understands (what runs the server app, so to say). It is doable to read such langauge if you disassemble the source files, but those are not stored in a database and you cannot just execute a code to get you those files.

    "a": "Airlines, and many other transportation systems, often try to run on a \"hub-and-spoke\" model, where most routes lead in and out of a few key locations.  This has a ton of benefits that save time and money for both the airline and the customer.\n\nProbably the biggest benefit is that it reduces the number of separate routes.  If an airline wanted to connect 20 cities together each with direct flights, they'd need 190 different routes, as compared to 19 if all flights went to a single hub.  With a limited number of planes, the hub system lets them run each route 10 times more often, which can more than make up for the fact that most customers have to take 2 flights.\n\nThere are also big benefits for organization.  With the hub system, an airline can put most of its maintenance and employee management facilities at the hub, it can make sure the hub is a high-quality airport with great facilities and good reliability, and it's easier to switch pilots and flight attendance from one route to another if they all live near the hub city.\n\nNow, some passengers do want a direct flight, so if passenger volume is high enough, the airline will offer it.  And often this one flight is cheaper than two, if you book early enough.  But airlines also charge more for flights that are nearly full, hoping to encourage passengers to take a less-full flight to even out the passenger loads.  That means that once the direct flight has sold most of its seats, the connecting flights will often be cheaper.",

Take common wifi devices and replace the tiny antennas with something more like satellite TV dishes and you can basically have wifi connection however far you can find line of sight, it'll work for hundreds of km if you point the antennas to each other. And that's with wifi which is very demanding because of how much data it pushes through.\n\nAccept lower data rates and you can reduce the demands for the antenna and transmitter power significantly. With LoRa is possible to have satellite connection with small undirected antennas and very low power transmissions, it's just that the datarates are puny, nothing like what you have for wifi [https://harmvandenbrink.medium.com/tracking-and-receiving-messages-from-satellites-with-lora-afafd875e005](https://harmvandenbrink.medium.com/tracking-and-receiving-messages-from-satellites-with-lora-afafd875e005) \n\nNow if you combine large highly directional antennas, puny data rates and fairly high powered transmission, then Voyager probes can phone home no problem.\n\nEven more capable than radio would be laser comms, your typical handheld laser pointer can be seen from space with a naked eye if you point it right.

For example, one or both might be using bluetooth beacons in-store to track which aisles you walk down with your phone and if there's a beacon at the register they can correlate that with a purchase. Best Buy would LOVE to know if when you buy a thing they stock at Target if it was an *impulse buy* or the purpose of your visit.

    "a": "First, \"extensive\" vs \"intensive\" properties isn't a terribly important concept in the first place, as they're seldom strictly true anyway. But the definition is whether or not the property depends on the amount of substance, \"intensive\" properties are ones that don't. \n\nPressure can be extensive. e.g. the ideal gas law pV = nRT; double the amount of gas in a box and you double the pressure. But if I have a rubber balloon in a room, the gas inside it is at atmospheric pressure regardless of how much gas is in it. In other words, it's context dependent. (hence not a terribly useful or important distinction IMO) Temperature isn't 'intensive' at the extreme either, since a single particle does not have temperature, it's a statistical property and the fewer energy states you have, the less meaningful the term is. \n\nAnyway, Dalton's law follows directly from ideal gas law and the underlying physical model, which is a gas of particles that do not interact with each other but only the sides of the container they're in. So adding molecules of a second ideal gas to a container does nothing to the first gas, and does not change the pressure it exerts on the container, but adds additional pressure from its collisions. I.e. Total pressure is a linear sum of partial pressures, insofar the ideal gas law is a valid approximation. In this system, pressure is _not_ intensive. (although that does mean Dalton's law's validity is dependent on whether pressure is intensive in your system. If you have a 50-50 gas mixture in a balloon it's the volume that's changing when you add or remove gas, but the total and partial pressures remain constant)",

For example, we could turn the word \"Reddit\" into \"082101100100105116\" using the ANSI character set as our letter-number mapping. The key thing this lets us do is turn the rules for constructing valid strings of letters &amp; symbols into mathematical operations. For example, a simple (and often incorrect) rule for pluralizing words with the mapping defined above would be times the number by 1000 and add 115 (the ansi value for the character 's').\n\nMathematicians have formal notations that they use for expressing sentences like \"For all numbers a, there exist a number b, such that a + 1 = b\" without any ambiguity. These notations are designed so that there is a basic set of known facts, referred to as axioms, and set of rules of inference that can be used to transform a sentence that is known to be true into another sentence that is also true. Within these notations, a proof is a sequence of sentences that connects the fact you want to prove is true back to one or more of the axioms through the rules of inference. As it turns out, doing this is actually pretty hard, especially when you want to prove that the something is false.\n\nWhat Godel did was to figure out that by turning these sentences into numbers and the rules into mathematical operators, you could use the techniques from a field of math called number theory to discover and prove things in general about the sentences. However, since number theory is also expressible as a formal system, you can do the same for it, leading to sentences like \"The number Y is a true in formal system X\" being able to be expressed as numbers and reasoned about using number theory.\n\nBy doing things like this, Godel discovered some problematic stuff: All formal systems are incomplete. There exist structurally valid sentences in every formal system for which neither itself, or it's negation can be proven to be true. Consider the sentence: \"Yields falsehood when preceded by itself\" yields falsehood when preceded by itself. Is it true or false? If the sentence is true, what it asserts is that it is false, and if it is false, what it asserts is true. Godel was able to create a version of this sentence into valid string in the formal system used by number theory, and then prove that it's paradoxical. He was then able to use the rules of number theory to show that all formal logical systems either can't express recursive statements, or they will have sentences that can't be proven true or false.",

Doctors just don't have the time to spend hundreds of hours working with each patient in attempt to find out why the individual overeats.

More exercise *also* means more calories, and vice versa.\n\nOnce your body consumes all of the calories it needs for the day, it will store the extra carbs and fats for later (your body transfers carbs into fats, which all becomes bodyfat).  Protein, however, is used for muscle maintenance and repair, and the rest is discarded.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is as follows:  0.75 grams of protein per pound of body weight for maintenance, and 1 gram per pound for growth.\n\nAlso see that protein is only used in maintenance and *repair*.  Lifting weights and exercising causes microscopic damage to your muscles, which your body uses the excess protein to repair.\n\nThe last thing to remember is that your body can only intake so much protein in a single sitting.  The upper limit is generally estimated to be about 40 grams of protein.\n\nConsistent exercise and a good diet will lead to good definition.  Good luck, and stay healthy!",

Spin isn't actually a thing Spinning, it's just a thing that fits for reasons beyond the scope of ELIF. Electrons are a type of particle that has Electro Magnetic charge. Muons and Tauons are the same but different because of reasons, buy they are not stable and decay into electrons. \n\nPhotons are the \"Force Carrier\" of the Electro Magnetic Force. These Force Carriers are how particles interact and their interaction with Electrons is why there is chemistry and you can see things. \n\nInside an Atom, the Neucleous contains Protons and Neutrons. Protons have a Positive Electo Magnetic Charge, Neutrons are Neutral. \n\nThey are both made of Quarks which are funky little guys and there are Six \"Flavors\" (wacky name I know, there are a lot of sensory words used to describe things that really only serve to categorize them). Up and Down are the common ones, and usually they come in 3s, but not always.

They each also have an associated Neutreno. These little bitty guys only interact through Gravity, which at the scale of Sub Atomic particles is Super Duper Weak, millions of them go through the tip of your pinky every seccond and you will never notice them. \n\nThere are other ones I don't know how to explain, but Hadrons, and Baryons are classes of particle that have to do with if their Spin is Whole integer numbers or Half integer numbers which again is getting into the SUPER mathy stuff, but that makes them different",

One of the things he is famous for is his contribution to determining the expansion of space (for which we now refer to the Hubble-Lemaitre law, or Hubble law). One of the earlier things he is famous for though is determining that some of the things in the sky are actually very far away (which we now refer to as galaxies).\n\nBefore Hubble's works, we didn't know what galaxies were, and we referred to both them and other stuff as \"nebulae\" (meaning cloud or fog), thinking that they were all just clouds of gas/dust. Hubble looked at a type of star called Cepheid variables which Henrietta Leavitt had previously shown (while working as a \"computer\" for Edward Pickering at Harvard College Observatory) could be used to measure distance due to having a relationship between it's intrinsic luminosity and period of fluctuations in brightness. By getting the intrinsic luminosity and comparing that to how bright it appears we can figure out how distant it is. \n\nHubble looked at some nebulae and discovered that some of them had Cepheid stars allowing distance measures, and when he did this he found that they were much, *much* further away than any individual stars that are not part of these \"nebulae\". This led to the argument that they are in separate \"galaxies\", with huge regions of empty space inbetween the galaxies.\n\nTo figure out the relation between Cepheid variables fluctuations and intrinsic brightness, Leavitt had to use a different way of measuring the distance to them. This was done using something called parallax, which is when we measure the change in angle as we observe from two different places (as Earth orbits around the sun). This gets harder as the angle gets smaller, and so we can only use it for relatively nearby stuff, hence why we needed Cepheids to look further.",

We measure fan performance relative to that theoretical ideal by something called \"isentropic efficiency\" (higher is better, you can't get over 100%). \n\nIn practice, this means each part of the fan generating as much lift as it can (fans are just wings going in circles) without any excess drag or turbulence or flow that isn't in the direction we want (backwards). \n\nThe geometry is really complicated because the flows are really complicated, for all the reasons /u/varialectio lists...different parts of the fan blade are going different speeds, different parts are sweeping different areas in the same time, the stress on the blade gets higher as you move away from the hub, there are enough blades that their wakes interfere with each other, etc.\n\nThen layer on some real world constraints like you can't go (very) supersonic, it needs to be durable (get hit by birds, etc.), you need to be able to actually build it and have it last for thousands of hours, etc.",

This way the enemy won’t want to nuke you for fear of said unacceptable damage.\n\nThis is the reason why every nuclear power that isn’t the USA or Russia [1] has around 300-400 weapons (China, France, UK, India…) and there isn’t an infinite nuclear arms race across the world. 300-400 nukes appears to be the mutually agreed upon threshold of “unacceptable” to make the idea of nuking you too unsavory due to your retaliatory power. Do note that these countries don’t just have nukes, but a fully functioning nuclear triad, which is important for nuclear deterrence.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to this, for example, countries like North Korea, Israel and Pakistan are suspected of having less than that 300-400 magic number (although Pakistan isn’t that far) because nukes for them are more of a regional deterrent than a matter of global nuclear security. Iran would also like to join that club, for reasons symmetrical reasons to those of Israel (they are close to each other and hate each other).\n\n[1]: USA and Russia have thousands of nukes for historical reasons: during the Cold War, they were effectively trying to bankrupt each other by endlessly escalating their weapons technology and posturing anti-nuclear “wonder weapons” that would make any less than thousands of nukes supposedly ineffective. Nowadays we know that the only real attempt in this direction (USA’s Strategic Defense Initiative) was a miserable failure, but the nukes remain, because no one wants to be the president who “halved our nation’s defensive capabilities”.",

This means that your game is most likely 64-bit as well, and cannot run on any 32-bit OS.\n\nGraphics card:\n\nA graphics card is basically a really big processor but it has dedicated VRAM and processes graphics instead of math things.  The cards listed are quite old compared to today's technology.  One of the most powerful graphics cards currently available is the [Nvidia 3090](https://store.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/store/?page=1&amp;limit=9&amp;locale=en-us&amp;category=DESKTOP,GPU&amp;gpu=RTX%203090,RTX%203090%20Ti) with 24GB of VRAM and many other high-performance features.\n\nThe generations you mention are the first number in the Nvidia line (1080, 2080, 3080) and the grade is the second number (3070, 3080, 3090).\n\nFor this game in particular, you should be fine with a 1060-or-greater, if I had to guess.  The 30-series cards were a sizeable leap for the cost, so if you want something long lasting, I would recommend one of those; if it's in your budget.\n\nFeel free to send me a message if you need any other help with PC parts!",

    "a": "There are quite a few things that go into the price of your food, but the biggest one would be energy.  Literally every step of food production uses fossil fuels in some way.  Want to plant seeds?  That requires a tractor.  Want them to grow well?  That requires fertilizer which requires fossil fuels.  Want to harvest your crop?  Need a tractor again.  Want to send your crops to market?  Load it on a semi truck.  This continues until you finally put it on your table to eat.\n\nAt the height of COVID gas was around $1.86 per gallon.  That cost was factored into the food.  The average price of gas now is about $3.80 if I remember correctly.  This increase is added to each step when it comes to manufacturing food.  Companies need to make a profit so they increase their prices to offset the rise of energy costs.\n\nAnother major one would be supply and demand.  Let's say you want some milk.  Because COVID impacted everything in the world, the supply of milk went way down as a lot of places were shut down or operating at reduced capacity.  Demand for milk on the other hand has roughly stayed the same.  If supply decreases and demand stays the same or increases, higher prices occur.\n\nLet's say you have 100 gallons of milk to sell.  Kroger and Safeway offered to buy your supply, but Safeway says they'll pay you more.  You naturally go with Safeway and then they increase the price of their milk to off-set the extra money they gave you.  You then create another 100 gallons of milk but this time Kroger increases their offer so it's higher than Safeway.  This keeps occurring as everyone needs milk.",

    "q": "ELI5: Why is horse riding ok?",
    "a": "It is in part down to the fact that breeds have been selectively bred over hundreds of generations to be ridden or work as draft animals. \n\nAs an analogue, how do you feel about huskies and other sled dogs being used as sled dogs? If not used as sled dogs, what would you propose they do? Because of their breeding, they have just a tremendous amount of energy and feel a compulsive need to run and pull. Sure, with good training they can be mellowed out calmed down, but even so, they are borderline unsuitable as pets in a lot of cases. \n\nAnyone who has worked with sled dogs, or any other specialized working animals, for that matter will tell you that these animals are happiest when doing what they feel in their genes they were created to do. And if you’re mistrusting of the people that work with them, why?\n\nThey’re the animals’ biggest advocates. The know a hell of a lot more about their temperament and disposition than anyone judging from a distance. \n\nPeople who runs sled dogs are out in the same weather with them. They’re checking them for physical issues religiously. They have a bond with each individual animal and understand their attitudes and body language. \n\nRace horses can be multimillion dollar investments. You think anyone is mistreating those horses? They get the best care money can buy. And when a racehorse has an unfortunate accident and has to be euthanized, it’s a tragedy for everyone involved. \n\nBut how many people die every year doing something that they love that is inherently risky? How many race car drivers have died after crashes? How many extreme sports athletes? Why is that acceptable in general?\n\nBiologically though, horses aren’t anywhere near as strong as elephants. That should be obvious. But we’ll need horses are plenty strong enough to carry a rider without significant issues provided they are in good health.\n\nThis is pure speculation, but I’d imagine those rescued elephants can’t be ridden because they’re not temperamentally disposed to it. They were very likely mistreated (hence needed to be rescued) , and having a rider on them could trigger them into acting out in unpredictable ways. Their caretakers don’t want them to kill any humans because of any trauma they experienced. I mean, you just never really want an elephant behaving unpredictably in any circumstance because there’s no way to stop it. There are plenty of places with well-trained, well-cared-for elephants that carry riders without incident on a daily basis with very few issues to speak of. \n\nThere will always be a debate about these issues because animals can’t offer informed consent to participate in such activities. In reality, it all boils down to the people controlling them. There will always be scumbag humans who abuse and exploit animals. And those scumbags will always be outnumbered by people who love, understand, and care for the animals they work with. These people will retire an animal with any physical issue that could pose a risk to it. These people give the animals the best, most attentive, and kindest training, care, and quality of life. They act as guardians and advocates for the animals and take that role extremely seriously based on their own personal relationships with them. \n\nA huge factor to consider in this debate is one’s purpose for existing. If horse racing and dog sledding were banned tomorrow, why would all these thousands (millions, perhaps?) of animals even exist? In animals, just like humans, purposelessness and boredom can lead to depression and other major behavioral issues that are in fact worse than just letting a dog pull a sled to burn off its excess energy. The only solution to that would be to just stop breeding these animals. And then they’d be gone. Extinct. Because humans gave them a specific purpose and then took it away from them. Is that acceptable on our part? \n\nSea World had problems, and that’s not even up for debate. But they kind of got painted in a bad light when it came to being a sanctuary for animals that weren’t fit to be in the wild. They were giving these animals years of extra life and potential breeding opportunities at the cost of their freedom to roam the open ocean (and soon die because of whatever issue they had). The training and performances were a byproduct of that because, again, we all need a purpose in life, and for those animals in those tanks, their purpose became performing. It was a way to keep them stimulated and engaged rather than depressed. The teams that worked with them did everything in their power to make their lives as good as possible given the circumstances. And they cared. \n\nYet they’ll go down in history as the heartless villains because corporate interests and big-picture activism overshadowed the work they did with those animals one on one.",

    "a": "The best I know related to this topic is the game League of Legends, because knowing that can help building a intuition on what item to buy, what buff to take, etc.\n\nFor example, in League of Legends, one character has 100 attack damage won't deal straight 100 damage to opponent, but that damage got reduced through armor. The formula for that is:\n\n\n    Dealt damage = Damage modifier x Attack damage\n\nWhile the `Damage modifier` depends on armor of the opponent like this:\n\n    Damage modifier = 100 / ( 100 + Armor)\n\nThus if he has 100 armor, the damage modifier becomes 100 / (100 + 100) = 100 / 200 = 50%.\n\nReplace it to the first formula:\n\n    Dealt damage = 50% x Attack damage\n\nSo the damage is reduced by 50% due to armor. A 100 damage attack can then only inflict 50 hit points.\n\nThat only applies in League of Legends.

If they have have *reasonable* *suspicion* (a specific legal term with a specific meaning, essentially, some specific facts to suggest you have committed a crime), they can detain you as long as it *reasonably* takes to to try to find probable cause for an arrest (more on probably cause in a second). The reasonableness depends on the severity of the crime, but it's not very long - a few hours at most. Then they have to either arrest you or let you go.\n\nIf they have *probable cause* (another specific legal term with a specific meaning. Essentially, they have more than reasonable suspicion, they have a substantial belief backed by evidence) they can arrest you. Once you're arrested, you'll be processed, and then arraigned (brought before a judge and the formal charges against you read to you). You must be formally charged within a short period of time (typically 24-48 hours depending on the state) of arrest or they have to let you go. This is also typically when bail is decided (more on that later).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Do people just carry on living their lives until the police do/don’t have evidence against them?\n\nIf the police don't have probable cause to arrest you or get a search warrant, or they arrest you and have to let you go because there's not enough evidence to charge you, then yes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;And when there is some evidence, but not enough for a definite conviction, is that when it goes to trial?\n\nA case goes to trial if the prosecutor thinks there's enough evidence for a conviction or there's no plea deal. Different prosecutors will have different thresholds for what they think is enough. Prosecutors can't wait forever though. The accused has speedy trial rights, and the prosecutor has to proceed with the trial in a timely manner or the accused has to be let go. It's important to note that the vast majority (more than 90%) of criminal cases are resolved by plea deals and never go to trial.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;​ Is the suspect detained from then on (unless they can post bail?)\n\nAt your arraignment or first court appearance after your arrest is when bail is determined. You can be released on your own with a promise to return, released with some conditions, given a bail amount, or kept in custody. Typically for a less serious offense or a first-time offender, they will be released or given a low bail amount. For a serious crime or a person with many previous convictions, they might be given a high bail amount or just kept in jail until trial or sentencing following a plea deal.",

    "a": "Proto = early, primitive\n\nIndo = related to India and southeast Asia\n\nIndo-European refers to a very large, broad family of languages. Languages evolve kind of like living things, branching out into new languages due to isolation. Like living things, you can study the similarities between languages to find a common ancestor, the original language that became both of the new ones that exist today.\n\nAs an example, there is the *Romance* family of languages, that all trace back to Latin: French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and some others. These languages have very similar grammatical rules, and even a lot of very similar-sounding vocabulary. Spanish and Portuguese are similar enough that often speakers can understand each other well enough to communicate across the languages. English is a Germanic language - it shares a common history with German.\n\nIf you continue tracing these languages back through time, you arrive at *Proto-Indo-European*. That is, nearly all languages in Europe *and* most languages in Southeast Asia (Hindi, Iranian, Farsi, and others) all derived from a single ancient language that linguists call Proto-Indo-European, meaning an early, primitive language from the area that includes most of Europe and much of Southeast Asia.\n\n[This beautiful illustration](https://minio.la.utexas.edu/lrc-prod/2020/05/26/HiH9Eis2ZPO1nLC6zub2nvaXpkPVHY9G13a4UEU9.jpeg) shows the family tree of Proto-Indo-European.",

    "q": "ELI5: Historically, has there been the opposite of \"Ice Ages\", and if so, what caused them?",
    "a": "There are several different ways to answer this:\n\nFirst, you have glacial vs interglacial periods.  We are currently in an interglacial period, what most people think of as ice ages are glacial periods.  These cycle back and forth on a timespan of tens of thousands of years (up to about 100 thousand years). These patterns are largely driven by changes in orbital cycles.\n\nThis pattern of glacial/interglacial alternation comes together to make an ice age. Properly speaking, any time the earth has permanent icecaps there is an ice age happening, which means we are still in an ice age.  Ice ages have come and gone through earth's history and don't follow a set pattern.  Many things come together to make an ice age, but an important factor is the position of the continents.  For our ice age, the separation of South America from Antarctica, and then the joining of South America to North America, seem to have played a big role.  \n\nThe opposite of an ice age in this sense is a greenhouse earth.  These are periods when there is no ice at the poles, and historically they have been more common than icehouse earths: periods with ice caps.  \n\nFinally, if ice ages are unusually cold we can talk about time periods when earth was unusually hot, even compared to the regular greenhouse earth state.  The most famous and recent of these was the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) when earth's temperature shot up to perhaps 12 degrees above what it is today.  There were alligators in the arctic!  This seems to have been caused by a massive CO2 release, probably due to volcanoes and perhaps a feedback with methane release from the seafloor.  This period is an important point of comparison for modern global warming...although fortunately we are at least starting from inside an ice age.",

    "a": "Two question, so two parts to the answer.\n1)Many antibiotics work by different specific mechanisms, but in broad strokes, bacteria use different proteins (Lego blocks of the cell) then people do. A good antibiotic fits into and breaks only those Lego blocks that the bacteria make, but that you don't. That way, they stop the bacteria cells from working, without also breaking your cells. Now, in fact antibiotics can hurt you. You have a lot of bacteria in you normally (your microbiome) that actually work with your body. Many antibiotics also kill these, and then your body has trouble doing things it used to. This can lead to metabolic disease and obesity, new food sensitivities or allergies; basically, any substance you ate that might have first been broken down some by those good bacteria now his your cells in a form that your cells never used to see, and that makes them freak out like their being infected, and you get inflammation.\n2) the infection is on your tongue, so how does swallowing something (moving it away from your tongue) help? The answer is that the pill dissolves and the antibiotic moves from your guts into your blood, where it circulates everywhere, including throughout your tongue. Given the side effects I described above, you may sometimes want to avoid taking this \"whole body\" (systemic) approach, which is why sometimes you can get away with local doses, as in a nasal spray or a topical cream. But if these don't get deep enough into the tissue, or (like on your tongue) wash away too quickly, then you have to choose between two possibly bad outcomes: an ongoing infection, out a potential messing of your healthy bacteria. Since infections can get really bad really fast, and the good bacteria have only really been getting studied since about 2011, most doctors recommend you cure the infection.\nHopefully with more scientific investigation, people can find new drugs that are even more specific to the Legos only on the bad bacteria, but that's not as easy as it might sound.",

    "a": "Tsunami heights are actually the highest run-up height. This is the highest point above sea level that the tsunami reached, anywhere. It is not the height of a breaking wave as you would see at the beach or on a surfing video. Most of the people who make internet animations are completely unaware of this, and it is very likely that the video you watched is pure twaddle. \n\nTsunamis are so destructive because the waves are very long from peak-to-trough rather than tall. In deep water a huge tsunami may only be centimetres tall, but it may be hundreds of kilometres thick and moving extremely quickly. As the front of the wave reaches shallower water it slows down, and the rest of the wave behind catches up. When the wave hits land it can keep coming for several minutes.\n\nThe highest run-up is usually at the end of a narrow bay, as a lot of sea water can come in at the mouth of the bay at a lower height and then is squeezed as the bay narrows. The tsunami in Japan in 2011 ran-up over 40m above sea level in a few places, and the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 flowed over a 50m+ ridge at one point very near the centre of the quake that caused it. Neither of those had breaking waves anywhere near those heights. The highest breaking wave videos from Japan show waves of 10-15m or so. In many places it did not form a 'wave' at all, appearing more like a rapidly rising tide. Some places in Japan had water flowing 20m+ deep at the shoreline at the peak of the wave and these flows continued for several minutes. This appears as the tide having risen by 20m rather than as a 20m tall wave.  \n\nThe highest run-up ever recorded was in the narrow Lituya Bay, Alaska, where a landslide on one side of the bay caused a wave that washed over a ridge on the opposite side. It's height is known because the wave completely washed plants and soil off of the ridge, leaving it bare rock to a height of 524m. Despite this, the tsunami here was MUCH less powerful than the two Ocean wide ones above, even though the wave went much higher. It was about 30m high further down the bay (where there were a few boats, at least one of which rode out the wave) and was barely recorded outside of Lituya Bay. The Indian Ocean tsunami in contrast, caused devastation thousands of kilometres away from its centre.\n\nHope this was helpful!",

Photosynthesis is known to have an efficiency rate of about 3–6% of total solar radiation[115] and if the entire mass of a crop is utilized for energy production, the overall efficiency of this chain is currently about 1%\"\n\nOpinion: The reason I think we still see it being produced is because it does still have that energy density and it can be used as a replacement for regular diesel, where converting infrastructure to electric is costly. We see this in the fossil fuel industry also where one barrel of oil from the tar sands requiring around one barrel of oils worth of energy to produce. To make it profitable you have to use cheaper fuels like natural gas.",

    "a": "Mandatory TPMS for cars has only been in effect in the U.S. since 2007 (phase-in started in 2005) and the EU since 2012. By that point we had reliable wireless technology, so wireless TPMS became the default. \n\nTo get absolute pressure readings from the tires requires a pressure sensor in the tire. This is called direct TPMS. Given how our tires are mounted, a rubber tire on a removable wheel, a wired connection for the pressure sensor would be quite difficult, since the only contact point for the wheel is the brake rotor. A wired connection here wouldn't be worth the technical hassle when a reliable wireless solution exists.\n\nThere are also indirect TPMS. These rely on wheel speed readings from the ABS to determine whether the tire is under-inflated or not. They can't tell you what the pressure is in the tire, only that it's lower than it should be. These systems are wired into the ECU/PCM.",

Meanwhile less desirable food sources (like  large woody tubers that have to be dug up and roasted for a long time) are  much more common.  \n\nSo it's like, if you don't find what you are after, you can always come back to camp and eat some of  those stringy yam-like things that taste like bark.",

There is no need to upgrade, because you don't want an untested program that might bug out. What you want is a program that has been patched over and over and over until it is ludicrously reliable.\n\nIn the offshore industry, you cannot always download an update in the middle of the ocean. And even if you could, you do not want your program to screw up in the first place when you are running $5 million worth of equipment on the seafloor.  Can you imagine if Windows 11 decided to force a mandatory update while hundreds of people were on standby waiting for the operation to commence? Therefore you use the same old program that you've been running for literal decades and has been patched over and over until it cannot possibly screw up.\n\nI was using computers running *Windows 95*. I mean, I was using computers running Windows 95 back in 1995, but I was also using one just a couple years ago, because it was the only operating system on which a control program for a highly specialized piece of mechanical equipment could run!",

    "a": "It's because of quirks in DNS.\n\nBack in the day, DNS didn't really have the ability to contextually differentiate what IP to respond with based on the protocol. If in 1986, you sent an email to user@example.com, the mail server would query `example.com` for its one and only DNS entry and send the emails to the IP that was returned. However, if a user opened their web browser and typed in `example.com`, that exact same DNS query would return the exact same address for the web browser as it did for the email.\n\nNow if your email server and web server were actually the same server, that could be fine. However, in many cases, email needed to be separate for a variety of reasons. As a result, they needed to differentiate web traffic from email traffic. They did this by adding a subdomain to one of the addresses. They could have made it `email.example.com` for your email addresses, but that would've had an adoption problem with every user effectively changing their email addresses. Instead, the `www` prefix was made a convention for websites.\n\nOf course, these days, we have a special handle in DNS for email. The DNS system will maintain an \"MX\" record (Mail Exchange), and mail servers will specifically ask for the MX record of a website. We also have made it much easier to map a single inbound IP to a variety of different servers behind it via port mapping, which is much more accessible than it was in the 80s.",

    "a": "\\&gt;&gt;Management learned to work with employee schedules and child-care needs, and didn’t lose a single worker to the Great Resignation.\n\nHmm, adapting to the needs of the employee, adapting to technology, and keeping pace with modernity pays off\n\n\\&gt;&gt;“We found that a lot of people were more productive at home,” Mortimer said. “Perhaps it was due to the lack of time commuting, relieved stress on family obligations caused during the pandemic or even everyday distractions being limited.”\n\nEmployees have at least an extra two hours a day, are not stressed out by the commute and extra time away from their families, and an extra two hours a day can absolutely make or break childcare arrangements. Happier employees are productive and loyal employees. Who knew?\n\n\\&gt;&gt;“Many workers in urban areas are continuing to experience the benefit of not being tied to a certain Zip code and moving to more affordable exurbs, whether to be closer to family and support structures or to ‘get more for their money’ and experience a different standard of living on their same paycheck,” said Yvette Cameron, an Oracle senior vice president who specializes in human-resource management software.\n\nNow employees can have a higher standard of living without the companies paying for raises.  While people moving into more affordable areas raises the cost of living for those people who already lived there this has the effect of lessening demand on housing and other resources for people who live in cities who can't afford to move. And for people whose jobs demand they be there in person. Such as hospital workers and emergency services.\n\n\\&gt;&gt;&gt;“What we’re definitely seeing is a shift away from these top 10 cities and toward both medium-sized and smaller metro areas — and actually a pretty big jump for rural employment,” said Gusto’s Wilke.\n\nThis is a considerable benefit. People who are tied to their communities because of family or lack of resources to move away now have chances for employment they would not have had pre-pandemic. This is an offset for the rising costs due to rising populations in smaller communities. \n\n\\&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But until we have better federal data on who works remotely and where they do it, we can’t produce the detailed analyses necessary to understand the winners and losers of the remote-work revolution — and to deal with the inevitable fallout.",

    "a": "It's worth noting the context of mutations which seems to be lacking in the story. \n\nMutations are extremely common. The overwhelming majority of mutations are bad or silent (have neither a positive or negative effect).\n\nThe emergence of a mutation or set of mutations that increases an organisms fitness is basically a numbers game. While the chance any given mutation will be beneficial is low, the note infections you have, the more replications there is, the greater the chance that a beneficial mutation arises and survives. \n\nThis is why vaccination is so important. It reduces the overall number of infections, and shortens the length of breakthrough infections. That means overall less viral replication, and therefore less opportunity for mutations, which means less chance of a beneficial one arising. Shorter infections also mean less chance of transmission so even if a beneficial mutation arises, it may not get passed on which means it dies out.  \n\nThis patient was infected for so long that over the trillions of times the viral genome was replicated in their body, on three occasions a mutation occurred that became dominant.

I get that some of those people might be low-wealth families, but surely there’s a way to means check that a little bit more?\n\nAnd even if they are, why is it just that someone from a low-wealth background or family, but is making $125k a year, should get what is essentially a $10k cash payment (costs the same for the government), but their other low-income family members should get nothing, just on the hopes that their the kind of person who is paying for their nieces music lessons? \n\nWhy not give it directly to the low-income people in the family? Or better yet, why not give it to the low-wealth, low-income family *without* the aunt making $125k who’s willing to help out? Surely a family without that kind of member is even lower wealth.\n\nIf in fact there was some data that showed that the student loan forgiveness (excluding the pell grant forgiveness), was actually progressive rather than regressive, I might be convinced.

Reason says evidence is needed to show that something is true, follow the evidence to wherever it leads.\n\nReason has given us tons of productive new knowledge.

But they turned it off and used reason when it came to their scientific work.\n\nAnd if religious people had solid evidence that god/soul/afterlife existed, they'd happily be waving it in our faces every day.

Systematic indoctrination has started a few years ago, far more than other cultures, yes not only at a young age that china is the greatest and you must be ready to die for china but you are in fact superior and thats why its your duty to your nation and your country most importantly to the CCP which is the “only” hope for china and no matter the cost they must follow every command.\n\n2. Othering all foreigners yea even other ethnic Chinese  that are not Han Chinese and a lot of instances only recently of foreigners being denied hotels, restaurant service and in addition you cant use public transport and some public services without a Chinese citizen ID (you can only get being born in china if your foreign you must get approval and this is rare). A rise in hostility to foreigners after a major increase in nationalism and anti foreigner sentiment from state media and legislation that aims to distract all domestic issues and blame this on foreigners especially the 0 covid policy to move blame CCP. This is extremely concerning to a large amount of citizens and my family who had to leave however not everyone of them could get out because they have control over this and travel bans to keep a strong population. And you cant have dissenting opinion so they are stuck being unable to speak out against this racism.\n\n3. Say what you will about the Uyghur situation because in truth we dont know much but they are quite open about at least re educating them to become han Chinese and banning inter marriage / culture and banning of any religious freedom that isn’t Chinese in nature so over time they will only become han Chinese and indoctrinating them into CCP ideology\n\n4. Complete suppression of the ability to uprise not only though the most rigorous surveillance and controlled / propagandised (unparalleled) society but over decades of crushing dissent in massacres arrests without trial (99% conviction rate with death penalty, more political executions a year than every ither nation combined and thats only Whats disclosed) but this has subconsciously trickled down and resulted in the population to be too conditioned not to intervene in crimes assaults theft’s abduction and even accidents. But also an extensive spy network to ensure order (only against those conspiring descent against the party not to make the country safer). One of the most common crimes convicted is Spreading rumours and miss truths which boils down to any topic the CCP doesn’t like.\n\n5. Not only is the CCP a one party authoritarian system where no average citizens can participate in the direction of government however now with Xi eliminating the opposition within CCP (CCP was stable for many years because there were factions inside that everyone voted for making it more akin to a democratic or at least a system that ensure power checking). \n\n6. High focus on military and expansionism of which they have burned bridges with ASEAN over in complete disregard for previous treaties and sovereignty (see public concerns from Vietnam, Philippines, India, Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand and Taiwan (Not a province never was under CCP it was agreed a two governance system to make up a whole china collectively but not just a province)\n\n7. Social hierarchy structure, this has been similar to other points however such a large part to the society it needs its own section. From the social credit system that not only ranks you and this will directly effect your access to healthcare, ability to enrol yourself and your kids in school, to rent cars and even to find a home to rent. If you dip below B you receive reeducation and C will ensure you are put on a list and receive increased inspections from the government to check what your doing and how to “be a better citizen”. Further falling to D will put you on a blacklist posted publicly for 5 years with officials visiting you often and can revoke your PHD’s and loosing jobs happens often with. This is not a sliding system which means you can be brought from AAA to D after one action at the parties discretion. Speaking out against the government is not a D offence as-well for that you will most likely be arrest or worst case disappeared so D can be smaller things. \n\nOccult situations has been previously mentioned and for this working in the government to expose those with “anti party sentiment” you receive significant point bonuses.\n\nWe are so incredibly upset at the direction things have moved and further upset at the lack of knowledge of this in the west however that has been carefully crafted by the CCP who in no way represents the beautiful Chinese people. Those who have fallen prey to the propaganda and are high level netizens do so become that is simply the system that has been in place for decades however it has regressed significantly since 2014.",

    "a": "Annually, people spend tens of billions of dollars visiting places that are walkable, dynamic, full of culture, and beautiful. Places like Paris, Kyoto, Amsterdam, Venice, Marrakesh, Bangkok, and many more. We save up for years just to chase a few days in the places we spend the rest of our time dreaming about. But why dream of visiting them, when we can live in them? Would it not be better to experience the places we romanticize about, all the time, adjusted for one’s local context, culture, and traditions?\n\n  \nMany people would dismiss this as romantic or idealistic. We don’t do that anymore. The places we used to build may be great, but it’s not possible to build like that anymore, or even desirable. But is that true? In this piece, I dispel some myths about why the communities much of us live in today aren’t the beautiful, walkable places of many people’s dreams (hint, it’s not price, cultural differences, or even that we’ve forgot), and that abiding by our status quo is willfully ignorant of common sense.  \n\n\n  \nMuch of what’s been built in the last 80 years in North America has been bad. From Homogenous sprawl and strip malls to wide highways, our communities have become banal, soulless, and ugly, On it’s own, this would be bad enough. But maintaining this way of building guarantees worse outcomes, that people don’t even really like, at greater expense than the types of walkable, beautiful communities we romanticize. \n\n  \nFar from being idealistic, we desperately need more of the types of places that we dream about. These places are not just “nice-to-have” or quixotic, as critics might suggest. When compared to our status quo of car dependent neighborhoods, the places of our dreams are better for our health (mental and physical), are more financially productive, and are significantly better for the environment. They also win more enlightened arguments of beauty, opportunity, serendipity, meaningful connection within communities, and culture. Building the places of our dreams is not idealistic. It’s common sense.\n\n  \nWhat do you think? Looking forward to hearing all of your thoughts on this piece, and talking with you about them! (Originally posted in r/TrueReddit)",

    "a": "I always took Occam’s Razor to mean, all else equal, prefer the simpler explanation. The main reason is to reduce the risk of overfitting. I can make any wrong theory fit the data by adding enough adjustment factors. Also, the simpler theory is easier to apply in practice.\n\nThe example of Ptolemy vs Copernicus is interesting. The heliocentric theory wasn’t simpler at first, because, being based on circular orbits, it was “wrong”, so it needed lots of fudge factors. When Kepler found that Mars has an elliptical heliocentric orbit, then, heliocentrism became simpler, and accepted.\n\nSo it seems that Okchham’s Razor worked. The author seems to be arguing that the razor was wrong to prefer Ptolemy’s simpler math to Copernicus’ “more correct” theory. There are a lot of ways you could look at it. Copernicus did get more accurate predictions, so they weren’t exactly all else equal. The razor is only a heuristic, maybe this is one of the times it was wrong.\n\nBut was Copernicus more correct? Geocentrism is obviously incompatible with relativity or even Newtonian gravity, so for us, it is. But without those theories, there’s no strong reason to prefer it. Kepler looks like real hero and his story is crazy. He created the most accurate Ptolemaic model ever for Mars, then rejected it as too inaccurate. I don’t know why he was the first to try an ellipse. Maybe the high accuracy of the latest observations motivated a wider search, or maybe mathematical techniques had come further. Either way, Kepler created a model that was both simpler and more accurate, an obvious major advance. Okkhamm’s Razor was irrelevant.",

It revealed the weakness of basic apparatuses of state administration, like up-to-date government databases. To face the crisis, we needed a society that gave far greater priority to care.

Plus American presidents are mostly buffoons, and I refuse to believe voters freely “choose” them without massive influence from parties, donors, and other power centers.\n\nThe real reason to prefer democracy is different, it’s that it better aligns the incentives faced by “rulers” with the needs of the “ruled”, although obviously the alignment isn’t necessarily that close in democracy either.

It makes me sick there are people obsessed with the killers who weren’t even alive in 1999. \n\nSometimes I think the medias lust for broadcasting such a tragedy only added fuel to the fire…thus inspiring so many copy cats who would commit mass murder and traumatizing everyone in their wake.\n\nEric and Dylan weren’t God like, they were both sick fucks who decided one day to plan this out, and the only way they felt power was with a gun. Not words, not fists, but a foreign object that has the ability to kill. That makes you a coward in my eyes. They were both too stubborn and fixed on this rampage to even give life another try. I’ve never understood how anyone could kill, let alone harm someone they didn’t know and never did anything to them. \n\nIf only people knew, what stories each fatal victim of gun violence could have had. What history they could have made in their lives. What their mark on the world could have been, and how much influence despite how small their impact may have been…extinguishing life is a sad and unevolved way of taking out psychological frustration. \n\nHonestly hope they both burn in hell.",

Art is constantly being created with the intent to show it to no one. \n\nThen the author goes on to equate \"working artists\" with all artists. Art does not need to be a career, and the idea that it should be (at least for the masses) is relatively new. As has long been the case, you have to be already wealthy the vast majority of the time to make art without \"selling out\". \n\nMaybe the market is oversaturated? Maybe the demand to buy art is different than the demand to enjoy art. Or, maybe, it's just not valuable enough on its own to support a large industry without being attached to another industry (like advertising).",

    "a": "While I agree with your point about gender changing, hormone therapy, etc. being potentially harmful, you say \"LGBTQ is affecting children and making them gay too\". Lemme strongly disagree:  \n\n\nNow, \"being gay\" and all of the similar concepts are relatively new concepts, things that our ancestors wouldn't have thought about . In the medieval society, someone who had the thought \"hey, my mate Jorgen is hot!\" would've dismissed it immediately because they could foresee the backlash and fury of the society towards such a sudden, radical change of ways. (Yes, I know there were some \"public\" cases of homosexuality, but let's dismiss them for the purpose of this argument)  \n\n\nNowadays LGBTQ makes efforts to clear this societal barrier, this stigma in people's brains that \"gay is bad\". Is anything in life really bad? Isn't it all subjective? You rob a bank, you're bad to the bankers and authorities, but you think of yourself as a hero and same do the friends you shared the cash with. Shouldn't people have the right to be how they want, to live how they want? (within the limits of law of course)  \n\n\nChildren are becoming more and more exposed to this realization, that something stigmatized by generations is possible and not something \"bad\". LGBTQ is not MAKING people gay. It is making people REALIZE they are gay. Imagine a boy being attracted to his male classmate and living without his love ever flowering and coming to fruition. Yes, a confession might be unconfortable for the receiver for the moment but they can always say \"no\". And then the gay child doesn't grow up with issues like depression, anxiety and hostility towards fellow humans, becoming a misfit, vandal, shutin...  \n\n\nIf someone wants a gender change, saying that'd make them happy, let them do it. Of course, they should take counsel with their parents and a specialist before, but don't straight out say \"you shouldn't do that\"  \n\n\nI used to be hostile to anything LGBTQ until a few years ago. The specific social context of your region and of course, religion, play a big part in your initial opinion on this. There are such amazing people in this world, and we all know there are bound to be a few rotten apples in the stack: I did get insulted and hurt by one member of the community but I related so well and enjoyed the wholesome discussions with a hundred (I'm exaggerating, but you get the point)  \n\n\nAnd being or not being part of LGBTQ has no influence on someone's performance at work. Being more manly, more girly, or identifying as a degree of neutral doesn't make you better/worse at your job. Heck, I'd even say that LGBTQ people have even more determination and \"fire in their hearts\" than \"normal\"  people. (and please don't use the term \"normal\", it's offensive, I did so I could give you this here advice)   \n\n\nCheers! This is my first CMV comment, so sorry if I wasn't formal enough or something or if I'm a weirdo.",

And poker is a game that doesn't work if you play it with worthless chips.\n\nIt absolutely does. I've done it. It's just like most games. You can bet on it, or you can not. In fact, it's more fun sometimes. Unless everyone at the table has the same amount of disposable income, some players will have substantially more betting power than others, producing a steep advantage. Games that are fairer pit players' skill against each other putting more emphasis on timing, reading people, bluffing etc.\n\n&gt;When it's chips you will call much more often, to see what's on the table.\n\nEntirely contextual. A rich man playing casually for money will call a lot more than a poor, but competitive man playing for plastic chips.\n\n&gt;But if you play poker you're suddenly diagnosed(by other people, non professionals) with ludomania, which is an officially recognized mental disorder.\n\nAnyone with even a passing knowledge of the term wouldn't use it like that. Any more than you'd be \"diagnosed\" with pyromania for cooking soup on a hob.\n\n&gt;In lottery, you are much more likely to be raped or killed on your trip to buy a ticket, than to actually win.\n\nWhich is part of why the lottery *is* stigmatized. It's often called a fool's game, a scam or \"the poor tax\". It's near universally decried.\n\n&gt;But people play tabletop games in club and lose a ton of money without winning anything.\n\nWhat? That's not gambling. It's only gambling if there is the hope to win the money you spent back.\n\n&gt;Yeah it can be supper addictive to people who lack self control, but the reason why it's addictive is because it's actually very emotional and engaging. All fun/emotional things are addictive.\n\nThat's actually not why. Check out studies on Skinner boxes, behavioural extinction and the sunk cost fallacy. It's addictive because of those reasons.",

The Unconscious mind is the Car which remembers every single bump and scratch that it is put through.\n\nThe unconscious mind accumulates damage and injury, particularly in childhood, and ultimately determines the capabilities and desires our conscious mind accepts to be our own. E.g If you’re car is worn out and unable to do long journeys, your desire to go on long journeys or take certain roads will decrease. Essentially how you travel will be shaped around what vehicle you own. Now bare in mind the unconscious mind and the conscious mind aren’t as intune as a car and it’s driver. They exist almost without direct communication.\n\nEverything you do, think and want is because your subconscious has decided that these things will improve your chances at survival, whether you they will or they won’t. Once your subconscious mind accepts that it will send signals to your brain that ultimately inform the opinion you make(good or bad). It possible to step out of this Matrix but honestly it’s extremely rare, even when you know about it.\n\n\nFree will is a Lie.

    "q": "CMV: \"Diversity\" or affirmation active hires are inherently racist.",
    "a": "Let me describe the perspective of being a hiring manager inside a relatively large Silicon Valley employer (~9000 employees) during a diversity hiring push. The primary thing we focused on was looking at ways that our process was failing to attract or properly evaluate under-represented minority (URM) applicants.\n\nThis meant things like writing several versions of a job posting so we could test the effect of things like requiring X years of experience with something versus simply describing the responsibilities of the role. We also A/B tested adding messages like, “don’t worry if you don’t have all the requirements…we’d still love to talk to you.”\n\n**Things we learned from this:** URMs have more imposter syndrome and are far less likely to apply for a job where they don’t feel 100% qualified. White and Asian dudes are much more likely to YOLO apply.\n\nThe next step in our process involved multiple phone screens. We wanted to see whether this step was discriminating against URM applicants, so for a while any amount of success in the phone screen would result in moving the candidate to the in-person phase.\n\n**Things we learned from this:** Many URM candidates who would have normally failed the phone screen ended up passing the in-person and having an offer extended. Far more than non-URM candidates, our phone screens were unnecessarily eliminating URM candidates. I don’t think we ever discovered why, but this learning led to significantly de-emphasizing the phone screen.\n\nThe next step was the in-person interviews. One idea that was floated was to ensure that the first interviewer the candidate saw was a similar minority to them (i.e. female candidates got a female interviewer, black candidates got a black interviewer, etc). It was hypothesized that it would help those candidates relax and do better in interviews. And we thought it would help with the second stage of hiring a candidate where they have to choose our offer above any others they received.\n\n**Things we learned from this:** it absolutely helped to match people to an interviewer of their race, mostly in the percentage of our offers that were accepted. However it was extremely counterproductive to match female candidates with female interviewers. We found that female interviewers were hypercritical of female applicants and it was very common for the only dissenting votes on a female candidate to come from the female interviewer(s). Improving gender diversity requires separate strategies from improving racial diversity.\n\nBut on to your point…is it racist? After all, we did significantly increase our diversity hires, though nowhere near being a representative sample of the larger community. The first defense of the policy is that we were never comparing candidates against each other. Instead, the decision was whether the candidate met our general standard to be hired. The final bar was never lowered for URM candidates, even if we did make it significantly easier to reach the in-person phase of the hiring process. Every diversity hire we made was qualified. Searching out and eliminating ways that your own process is structurally racist isn’t, itself, racist. The second is that it’s possible to increase diversity hires by solely trying to appeal to diversity candidates. Showing them that their work environment would be more diverse makes them (Duh!) want to work there more. Even without changing anything else about the hiring process, this part worked for us. It’s hard to imagine that being more welcoming to minorities could be construed as being racist.",

    "a": "Hi, professional statistician here (PhD in stats). I actually agree with you. \n\nStats can be just as much an art as a science. When calculating statistics there are so many judgement calls. For example if we are calculating stats about low achieving students what we define as low achieving is subjective. Often in non-statistical papers these judgement calls are brushed over. Then there are other questions such as are weights used in the data and if so how are the weights calculated. How was missing data addressed? What was the sample size and sample design? Are the papers reporting the variance and standard error? Also, when reporting the “average “ does one mean the mean or the median? Many would argue that the median is more appropriate for data with long tails (long tails meaning outliers). Etc\n\nThen within statistics there’s the huge problem of p-hacking. P-hacking is basically manipulating the data until one gets a significant finding. Can’t remember where this quote came from, but it’s fitting here: “if you torture data long enough, it will say whatever you want”\n\nObviously, I think statistics are important or I’d be in the wrong field. But they are not the end all be all. Statistical literacy would greatly help in understanding the place of statistics. Statistics are one piece in the larger picture of how our world works and is flawed as are all sciences.",

When someone calls a place a shithole I think what's often more relevant is *why* they think that place has become a shithole. If they're saying it because \"something something Africans are worse people\" than yeah they're a racist but if they're calling it that because they think the government there has done a poor job of supporting the city or the citizens (as seems to be more the case when referring to US cities) I don't think it's as comparable. Certainly someone could refer to, say, Chicago as a shithole and their reasoning is because \"all the black people shooting people\" well than I'd agree that's comparable to my pervious example with countries. \n\nMy overall point though is just that the context here is much more important than the words used.",

    "a": "&gt; What I mean by the title is that kids don't know enough to accurately say they are trans. \n\nBut they do not enough to accurately say that they are “cis” or in any way state their gender?\n\nOr might you be someone who tells a little boy when he tells you he's a boy “*You're not old enough to know that yet.*”. — You'd certainly  a rare one then.\n\n&gt; Additionally, since transgenders are a much smaller group than cisgenders, the only responsible decision is to postpone any bodily changes until the child reaches 18 and can consent. \n\nAre they?\n\nHypothetically,  I do not find the idea at all that there are exactly as many “cisgender” as “transgender” persons and that 98% of persons whom they call “cisgender” are best called ”agender” at all an implausible thing when talking to the common man on the street.\n\nThis discussion recently flaired up in my family and we talked about it and each and every one of my family members said that really  they'd have no problem living as either sex. — I find this to very much be the opinion of most persons.\n\n&gt; But allowing a 10 year old to undergo gender reaffirming surgery or hormone therapy is immoral.\n\nThe problem is that natural puberty is just as irreversible as hormone therapy, in fact, that is what hormone therapy is, simulating the puberty of the opposite sex.\n\nSay we have little Alice who has been given by his parents a wonderful name to affirm his gender as female, but, little Alice when 8 expresses that he would rather be male. His parents share your view and some problematic things happen if little Alice is allowed to undergo “female puberty”, which is again, more or less the exact same thing as the hormone therapy that would be given to little Bob if he were to say that he'd rather be female instead.\n\nWhat happens is that little Alice will now grow breasts, his growth wil be shorter than he would desire most likely, his shoulders will not widen, and his facial structure will feminize.\n\nNow, he is 18, and he can start the hormone therapy. The problem is that the damage has already irreversibly been done: his breasts now have to be amputated leaving scars and an artificial look: he is forever very short for a male; testosterone can only partially undo the damage of his natural faminized face: the end result is a short, narrow-shouldered, high-pitched speaking male with a rather feminine face and mastectomy scars and of course a vulva.\n\nWhat he could have become had he started hormone therapy at the start of puberty was a normal, average male in every way except for the vulva.\n\nI hope you see the problem with your thesis. — In the end, not giving hormone therapy to little girls to make them men, is exactly the same thing as giving hormone therapy to little boys to make them women; all hormone therapy does is simulate that natural process artificially. It injects the exact same hormones the other sex naturally produces.\n\nTherefore, could you answer why it is “immoral” to give little Alice these hormones, all the while forcing little Bob these exact same hormones you denied Alice, while Bob does not want them, and Alice does? Is it truly simply because Bob has a penis and Alice a vulva, even though apart from that, their bodies are exactly the same and the hormonal effects on their bodies is exactly the same?",

    "a": "As someone whose taken writing classes, I can tell you we do not write in isolation. We do not pen a work and then publish it without thinking about our audience. That's a big driver in a lot of factors; including how we write. Good authors are constantly thinking about how they can get their intent across to their intended audience without any miscommunication. However, not all authors are good.\n\nAn author has a responsibility to make their intent fairly straightfoward to their intended audience in their book. If it's a political book for adults, it should be made clear what positions they support or are trying to convince the reader to support/think about. If a kid's fiction book, any morals they want the kids to take away shouldn't be something hard to find. Adult fiction should clearly set up characters personalities, etc. None of this \"Well I intended to make the character kind\" does any good when we see the character kicking puppies in the book, as an extreme example.\n\nAn author's intent and an author's ability to write that intent into their work is not always equal, therefore the intent shouldn't be the only thing that matters. How that intent comes through to the audience also matters. Whether the author is writing a book that is for the intented audience or not also matters (ie, if your'e writing a book for kids but it has too much violence in it, or too high a vocabulary level, etc). \n\nTLDR: Your view puts all the responsibly on the readers to figure out the author's intent, and none of it on the author to clearly communicate their intent.",

    "a": "For problems 1 and 3, we have that now already. For the power vacuum, I'm not sure how much of a problem that is. How much are you conflating Libertarianism and Anarco-Capitalism? There does need to be government, but there should be as little as possible. \n\nMonopolies are a problem, but they're the natural result of inevitably someone making it to the top, then using their power to stay there, then stagnating once they're secure in their monopoly. Government is creating something just as dangerous to solve the problem. The main reason monopolies are a problem is that you have to cooperate with them to do anything, often even get food. A government is always a form of monopoly in that sense, and needs to be thought of as such. \n\nBesides, currently the government is controlled enough by the interests of corporations that it's becoming far more a tool of corporations to oppress people than it's job of defending people from them. Potentially a smaller government might be less easily corrupted, but in general a government that doesn't interfere with things as much is harder to corrupt because they're not interfering with everything, and far easier to scrutinize when it does. \n\nThe environment is however a problem, mostly because Libertarianism basically predates people caring about it. That said, a lot of pollution issues would be fixed by allowing people to sue for it. That's not going to stop cities from filling with smog though, as everyone is part of the problem. But when everyone is part of the problem, what do you do? Look at the various things being done to solve that problem now, how much impact it has on people, and all the various costs of it.\n\nSpecifically, the problem with how they did handle smog was that it made cars substantially more expensive, as well as being more complicated, less user serviceable, and far worse when they first did it. This is a perfect example of the government deciding something and passing the costs onto the people, many of whom don't want it. While completely ignoring the environment is just as bad, sudden dramatic shifts like that are best avoided, and given the gas crisis, we probably would have gotten more efficient cars soon enough anyway. Though we might closer to European cars, in that fuel efficiency would be a higher priority than emissions. \n\nAnd this brings me to the third point. The free market does things better than people managing the same thing. An impractical idea from the market dies because no one buys it. An impractical idea from government can be forced on people for as long as the government wants. Microsoft can only push Zunes until it has to stop or go broke, while the government could send you one, tax you to pay for it, spy on you with it, and arrest you when you eventually get mad enough to throw it away. In theory you could manage something similar with direct democracy or some sort of system where the government cant force people into things, but I doubt it's practical.  That said, imagine if social security or something was just something you could opt out of, in that you never paid taxes for it, but also never got it. I like the thought of a system where every service is like this, with it's own tax that you can opt out of both. I wonder if that could ever work.",

There is no objective truth for how men should act. Everyone is different. That's whole impetus for this entire gender movement, in fact: for many years both men and women were relegated to very rigid gender roles, whether they liked or not.

But if you're going to put time into solving racism, that's where to start.\n\nIt is likely to be effective. Empirical evidence shows that friendships between groups leads to less prejudice (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-03176-007), and that even an outright door-to-door approach trying to discuss issues of identity can also do so (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad9713).\n\nIt may be dangerous to change the minds of outright white supremacists and klansmen, but you could also do so with less dangerous individuals. Archie-Bunker style racists could more easily be swayed and are less risky to confront. Most journalists that cover the klan have been white, precisely because they expect to be in less danger, so perhaps *those* ones could be left to white folks, but that doesn't apply to every racist.",

    "a": "I do support the idea of assisted death under specific circumstances, but that's another topic.\n\nBefore I proceed to voice my opinion on your post/view, let me say this first - I'm sorry to hear you're facing this illness, and as have somewhat limited knowledge about it - I hope my comment won't offend anyone.\n\nTechnology and medicine are progressing rapidly in the 21st century, and this trend should only continue going forward.\n\n10-20 years ago HIV couldn't be cured, thousands of people had no hope of the cure being found before they died of AIDS. Today there are already records of first people being cured of HIV. Some forms of cancer weren't treatable (or had extremely low survival rates) 10-20 years ago, today those rates increased significantly, and there is actual hope that technology+medicine may be able to cure some forms of cancer without chemo/serious surgical intervention. The list of such examples could go on and on.\n\nNeuroscience is making progress as well, and with the help of rapidly advancing technology there will be significant progress made in that area as well. Medicine/pills as well.\n\nYou're facing depression for the last 8 years, but you can't know if you'll still have it to the same extent 10-20 down the road. \n\nMaybe you'll get a better doctor who will prescribe more effective pills that suit you better. \n\nMaybe you'll get a therapist who will teach you how to handle your thoughts and feelings, help you to effectively rewire your brain by creating effective routines/habits/rituals that actually help you.\n\nMaybe you'll come across some amazing self-help book or TedTalk/etc video on the topic of depression that will work wonders for your specific type of depression/symptoms when you apply the methodology.\n\nMaybe you'll choose to study psychology or neuroscience yourself and  you'll get to study your brain and help yourself and others by making breakthroughs in treating depression.\n\nMaybe you'll find a rewarding activity that will give your life purpose, and that will eventually give you emotional gratification *knowing* you made *a difference* in somebody's life (looking after abandoned puppies in a shelter, saving innocent animals from abusive owners, helping elderly people in need of help, improving parts of nature you like/care about, etc.). Finally. realizing that if you had stopped living, numerous people/animals would not have received your help and possibly would be in much worse situation without you helping/looking after them. Maybe you'll even find like-minded people you'll be able to connect with.\n\nYou know what happened in the past and what is happening in the present. But you can't know the future. You can imagine it, guess it, presume it. \n\nYou were unhappy, you are unhappy, but you can't know for sure you will *always* be unhappy.\n\nThere are so many variables that can change our life to the better or worse - you can't know for sure what will happen in 5-10-20 years. The world moves very fast. What if a good treatment for depression is found in 5-10-20 years? What if you find an effective workaround through numerous searches yourself and become happy at some point\n\nMany variables are out of your control, but some are. Humans can achieve many great and unbelievable things when they try, repeatedly. Even when the odds are against them. Thousands of examples out there on the internet. \n\nSuicide/assisted death should be the absolute very last resort for only really hopeless cases: 1. when doctors/therapists confirm nothing more can be done (because *everything* was tried and *nothing* worked), 2. when nothing and noone else can help to improve life quality, 3. when there's no hope that the **future breakthroughs** could improve the situation/treatment.\n\nWhile depression is a horrible illness, the three criteria are not fulfilled and therefore it does not make sense to consider suicide/assisted death. It's too way early for that. \n\nInstead, all daily focus and efforts should be invested in attempting to improve your life quality, finding purpose in life, searching how you can help yourself, exploring which activities/hobbies/work interest you or give you some sort of joy.",

It'll mostly help people with 2 year degrees or less. \n\n2) People with 2-year degrees or less do earn more than people with no degree on average, but not by a ton(40kish vs 50kish). \n\n3) An additional 10K relief goes to Pell Grant recipients who only receive aid if their families couldn't pay for their college. \n\n4) We've had 10% inflation this year, give or take. This is hitting people lower-middle class(sub 100k) the most. \n\n5) As others have noted, another stimulus check would drive up inflation further. \n\nAll these things *together* considered, this student relief is mostly targeted to reduce the burden on a portion of the population that could very much use it, and it does so in a way to try to avoid exacerbating overall economic conditions. For people in this group, ranging from technicians to people who just dropped out, it can be a massive win to have 20k in debt erased because they *can't* afford student loans unpausing this year.

One of the top comments also mentions your post history, so I can imagine you’ve seen more of the ugliness of human nature than others.\n\nAnyway, you say you dislike most people. Anyone can find valid reasons to dislike anyone. Maybe they’re the wrong reasons. Consider that some people like your co-worker may not realize how they come off to others, and if they did they would try to change that. Many people seek joy by forming real friendships with others, which is in a sense self-serving but also others-serving at the same time. The way societies and people get better is when we all realize we have a big problem, each of us is part of the problem, and join together in spite of that. Misanthropy is what has given birth to every human atrocity in history.\n\nIf you’re not actively mistreating people as a result of your perspective, I’d say the person you’re hurting most right now is yourself. Such an attitude is going to wear on you mentally and emotionally if it hasn’t already. Loneliness is a strong predictor for poor health.

Russia is essentially finished all because they felt the need to invade Ukraine.  Had they never invaded Ukraine, they could have kept Crimea (which they will probably lose now) and would have made it impossible for Ukraine to join the EU or NATO simply by interfering with them so much that neither entity would have felt comfortable with them joining.  Now it seems inevitable that they'll join both organizations in a short period of time AND that they will have such a powerful military that Russia would NEED to use nuclear missiles to stop them because their conventional forces wouldn't be enough.  Russian military exports are also going to go down the tubes after this war especially since they can't build most advances weaponry due to sanctions.  Not to mention that there is now plenty of doubt that Russia military equipment will even functional as designed.

LOTR also has eugenics concepts: Aragorn is more powerful because his Numenorian blood is not mixed with that of \"lesser men\". In Bree there is talk of \"half breeds\". The Easterlings are painted as bad etc.\n\nWhile it isn't racism the trolls and the orcs in LOTR and the Hobbit talk in a kind of cockney accent which isn't exactly flattering to the cockneys of London and is bigoted by modern standards.\n\nThe Amazon series looks laughably bad for the record. I'm also sure they will try to shoo-in a lot of boring woke stuff. They will probably do that because they perceive it as good marketing.

The only time I've seen people slow down and take driving seriously is when they believe they're going to get a ticket. \n\nMore driving classes are going to do absolutely nothing. The only things I learned from there were what signs meant and thats about it. My fiancées younger brother has been driving since he was 16 with no license or parent. He took drivers ed but states he can't get an appointment for a license (I call BS but there's not much I can do). We only drove once in his car and man he does not care about the rules. He even modified his car to make extra noise. He screwed up his vehicle and the parents got him a used BMW. How is more classes going to stop people like that?\n\nI believe holding parents accountable for their children ( I'm thinking 18 and under) will make a small dent on the horrible drivers. Currently if a 17 year gets pulled over they are the only ones who get in some trouble not the parents but if the parents also got fined I bet you that kid would not be driving by themselves. \n\nOne last note. Living in Chicago I learned about ticket faeries. They are people who go around checking parked cars to see if their time is expired their stickers are up to date etc. If we had a chain of people like that to give tickets for reckless driving that would definitely make people think twice about goin 60 in a 25.

But the current state of the world is absolutely a function of all of the political decisions made before us, and that's why we've moved on to new topics. The direction we go now will absolutely impact the people in the 22nd century. \n\nIf everyone in the 19th century took your view that it was ok to be 'apolitical', with no interest in learning, advocating, or voting, we'd still have legal slavery. If everyone opts out, that's how you end up in a situation where nothing ever changes. Looking back you don't see any moral failing on the people who sat by with slavery and said \"eh doesn't impact me, I don't really care if we keep having slaves or not\"?\n\nThis is a 'tragedy of the commons' issue. If you decide not to learn, discuss, or vote -- you could be right, maybe nothing will change. But if everyone makes that same decision, we'll end up in a world that most people consider far worse off. If there really was \"nothing wrong\" with it, we should be equally well off if everyone makes that choice if you believe that you'd have to think we're equally well off in comparison to a world where slavery was not ended and civil rights were not pursued.",

    "a": "&gt; I see no merit, and only danger in transitioning to a gender you identity with. This is ESPECIALLY true when you are young and underdeveloped in mind, body, and sexuality.\n\nI'm a 26 year old trans man who started hormones when I was 19 and had top surgery when I was 21. I've never regretted either, and both have *significantly* helped my mental and physical health. Before testosterone, I had really bad anxiety and depression based on how others perceived me, which has gone away now. Before top surgery, I had to bind my chest, which can cause complications if done for too long of a time period, but the alternative was again, mental distress. I'm at a place in my life where I am only seen as a cis man by anyone who isn't aware I'm trans, and even then, I've had my friends not believe me at first. I live my life extremely happily as a man, and I know that if I were to have to revert and live as a woman, all of my depression, anxiety, and suicidality would return. \n\n&gt;  I just cannot get over my hunch that its all a big scam to lock people into unnecessarily surgery like the plastic surgery industry. Trick young, impressionable people into dangerous surgery which will require constant maintenance for life.\n\nMany surgeries don't require constant medical maintenance for life. With my top surgery, I saw my surgeon maybe three times afterwards, but since, I haven't seen him at all. My doctor who prescribes hormones hasn't even seen my chest as far as I can remember. Plenty of people pay money for their medications that give them a better quality of life, like viagra or hair loss pills. Why is it different when I'm trans? It saved my life, so for me, it was, and is, life-saving medicaiton. \n\n&gt;    Why cant we identify as what we are and just be happy expressing ourselves in that way? Why do trans rights activists harp on life-altering medical treatment, especially for impressionable youth? Legally, people under 18 can’t even give consent under any circumstances, so why does anyone trust that they know that their chromosomes were “incorrect” from birth?\n\nI do identify as what I am, a man. I'm very happy expressing myself this way. When I look in the mirror, I no longer feel panic or scrutinize every part of my body. I don't have panic attacks trying on clothes anymore. Walking through my life as a man feels natural, meanwhile living as a girl was painful to the point where, had I not gotten gender-affirming care, I would have killed myself years ago like I planned to. \n\nYou're speaking about a large community of different people. Trans people are not a monolith, and medical treatment of trans youth is debated even within our community. Many trans people believe that youth should have access to hormones, many do not. Many believe that at minimum, puberty blockers (which were developed for cis youth, and have been proven to be safe and reversible) should be available for trans youth. That way, if they continue to identify as trans, they are spared a lot of mental distress and may have less expenses and medical intervention as adults.",

The existence of sexism doesn't unmake racism. With the exception of crimes that involve child victims, men are sentenced for longer than women for the same crime.\n\n&gt;I don't think it takes much of a leap of logic here and again think this is likely due to culture.\n\nYou know racism is cultural right? It's an aspect of a culture, just like piety, traditionalism, expansionism etc. Saying \"it's not racism, it's culture,\" is like saying \"it's not a dog, it's an animal.\" It could well be both.\n\n&gt;I think that the reasons we see these disparities specifically with black people is due to cultural and wealth issues, not rasism.\n\nAgain, I have explained that \"it's cultural\" is not a refutation of racism. But you mention something interesting; wealth. Wealth is well known to tie to criminality. I guess if we found that wealth disparities existed between races as a result of racism, that would suffice as explanation for criminal disparities. Things like redlining, segregation, lack of equal pay laws existed until relatively recently. They existed in the lives of people who are still kicking today.

Under your model, I would have been shit out of luck.\n\nNow let's also take into account leasing.  From what I can see, almost 30% of new sales were leases.  If you have ever ordered a car, sometime it doesn't come in exactly when planned.  If your lease is ending and your new ordered car is delayed a month or so your SOL your either going to be over your limit or over your miles.  Or your forced to extend your lease contract.\n\nOr if you happen to have a lemon that the manufacturer is going to buy back.  If you don't have an option of finding a new one on the lot are they going to supply you a rental car for you until your new car is built?  Ordering a new car should only take 8 to 12 weeks but sometimes much longer.\n\n\n\n\nI get this is a smaller percentage of problems for people but these are reasons dealers are useful.",

    "a": "&gt;Corporation is legally obligated to be as greedy as possible\n\nThis is only true to a certain extent.  There is no objective path that a company must follow to follow through on this.  For example, wouldn't it then be illegal for a company to donate money to a charity because that takes away from profits?  but you might argue that the donation buys good will and that good will makes the company more likeable and by being more likeable it ensures its long term success which will lead to more money.  The same could be said about paying workers fair wages, selling products and services for fair prices, and having ethical practices, while it might make less money in the short term, it can boost the value of the company by improving its standing in the community.\n\nSo a corporation absolutely can do things that don't maximize profits especially in the short term.  if a corporation was legally obligated to maximize profits at all times for their shareholders, the only logical option would be to find another company to buy out the entire company.  There is no way you could earn your shareholders more money than a 1 day full realization of the total value of the company.",

You don't need to make them choose between careers. You can make a system where women can have a successful career and be a good mom.\n\nFurthermore, this would shift a lot of the cost from the government to the corporations who hire.

    "a": "&gt;You saw the birth of technology come from nothing to something literally as you grew up, etc. Computers, video games, phones, cameras, music players and so on.\n\nSorry, but that is a completely baseless claim. Computers, video games, phones, cameras, and music players all existed well before the turn of the 20th Century. The birth of technology happened millennia ago, the birth of new technology is constant. Nothing special about that decade.\n\n&gt;A super big part of me especially was video games. As someone who didn’t get a phone till I was 14 I lived off of my Gamecube, DS, small ass iPod and Xbox 360 growing up. There was something just so special about your friend calling your landline phone and asking to come over to play some basketball then having a sleepover playing video games all night on a hot summer day. Games like cod Mw2, bo1, bo2 and Minecraft were peak and so much fun with friends back then. That’s why I respect indie devs and companies like Nintendo, from software and rockstar for always making games with passion behind them not just soulless cash grabs like Ubisoft.\n\nYour second point is just anecdotal evidence, nothing to suggest those without such devices had worse childhoods. To me, it is actually sad to consider that living through a screen would be a good childhood. I didn't have any such experiences and I don't care. \n\n&gt;You got to experience the best of both worlds when it came to music as in all your elders/parents loved 80s music and you grew up with super good 2000s/early 2010s music.\n\nBy that logic, the more recent you are born the better the childhood because then you have access to even more music. \n\n&gt;Internet flash games were literally the most fun games to play in elementary school or just at home. \n\nFor you. I would prefer a game of monopoly, or scrabble. Nothing in your argument is grounded in quantifiable reality, it is just rose-tinted glasses in a very America-centric viewpoint. Your experiences do not define generational childhood quality. What statistics do you have to support your view? More children around the world are educated than ever; they are healthier than ever; they are safer than ever; they live in less poverty. That is tangible evidence, not nostalgia.",

Before having sex, women know what sex can lead to, and potentially what could come from having sex. It’s all public knowledge that things like birth control, condoms, etc aren’t 100%, but when used responsibly, most time they prevent women from getting pregnant when they don’t want to. With that being said, having sex in situations where women consent to participate in said sexual encounter, they’re responsible for what comes out of that. \n\nBut ***who*** was the consent given to? The man she had sex with of course, for the purpose of allowing him to engage in sexual activities with her body (and vice versa). \n\nEven more, the fetus did not even exist at the point of sexual intercourse, but only came into existence some after that (conception takes up to 24 hours after the act). Consent usually requires a consent giver, a consent taker and a specific moment in time where the consent is communicated from the giver to taker.

    "a": "**SMP Voting**\n\nThe fact that there are two predominant parties is an outcome of SMP (Single-Member Plurality), also called FPTP (First Past the Post), voting. This has been discussed in other comments.\n\n**Fixing the Problem?**\n\nThat aside, let's suppose the implausible: You managed to pass a constitutional ammendment to get rid of the electoral college, reform federal elections, and pass sweeping voting reform across all states such that the voting system is fixed to no longer naturally produce a two-party system. Given that supposition, then are the problems fixed?\n\n**Economy and Culture**\n\nAmerica has a deeply held and historically rooted culture of white supremacy, Christian supremacy, male supremacy, cishet supremacy, etc. It is a culture that venerates hierarchical relations and cherishes their violent enforcement.\n\nAmerica is *the* global hegemonic superpower. The foundation upon which this is built is capitalism. Capitalism fundamentally produces hierarchical economic relations through the transfer of wealth in the form of profit to a select class of people.\n\nIn the 1970s, in reaction to the progressive policies of FDR and the gains of the Civil Rights era, the process of synthesizing these cultural fixtures with this economic system was set into motion. The product of this synthesis has many names: neoliberalism, neoconservatism, right wing populism, the alt-right, Trumpism, the new right, white nationalism, Christian nationalism, America first, American Fascism, etc. Whatever you want to call it, *it is here now*.\n\nThe entrenchment of a two-party system can't have helped, mind you, but it's a far cry from being the source of the problem with the system.\n\n*That which is eaten is the food of power* and you're on the menu.",

With the advent of print you had your Playboy models or pin up girls, again able to out earn the average if they were successful. Only fans is nothing new, it's just modernising this industry into the information age. Why should the most successful artists not be rewarded like their predecessors were?\n\nYou might think it's an easy job, but clearly you can't do it. It's only a few who have the looks/talent/commitment/psychological robustness to actually make a career from it. \n\nI don't see why this is bad for you? You'll have to explain how someone else having a successful career demoralises you, I really don't see the connection. If anything doesn't it motivate you?

I forget to let my son be his own person, because I’m a bit OCD/perfectionist/boss/leader/always right/kinda selfish dick-ish, and unfortunately I wasn’t able see how much my EGO raised my son instead of my true self.. so if I could do it all again I would put my ego in check before I entered into parenting…luckily for me, my son is only 18, still lives with me, and I feel like I still have time to right my wrongs with him.

    "a": "I tend to agree with you. I think that with a lot of poems that people don't \"get,\" though, it isn't necessarily the obscure message. Sometimes there's no clear meaning, no clear rhyme, rhythm, or structure, or nothing else to really latch on to, so all there really *is* in that kind of poem is to ponder \"what does it mean?\" And there's nothing wrong with that exercise of trying to squeeze some kind of meaning out of something, even if it isn't even there. \n\nI think an analogy that perhaps better underscores the point you're making is with music. I've known many people who like songs because they like the lyrics and what the lyrics mean. But for me, that's always been kind of backwards - I enjoy songs for how they sound first, and the feelings they inspire, but I don't need to know the meaning to enjoy them as some people do. Sure, if a song's lyrics match the feelings they create in a good way, that enhances it. But it isn't *required.* And sometimes, if the \"meaning\" of the song is *too clear*, that meaning gets in the way of the transcendent qualities of the music, making one *think* rather than *feel.*\n\nAs such, I've enjoyed a great deal of instrumental music, music in foreign languages, and music with very cryptic lyrics",

I currently have a VA assigned community care provider. Due to distance from the VA, and regularly it is difficult to get a prescription filled from the VA... Because they're so used to refusing community provider prescriptions that they refuse ones they shouldn't. \n\nI also have ACA medical care, through Medicare Advantage - The flexibility of getting an appointment scheduled and not having to wait 6 months for the VA to figure out how to approve and schedule one could be life-saving.",

    "a": "&gt; Republicans put up an amendment in the senate to the inflation reduction act aimed at helping protect middle and lower class individuals and businesses (Making lower than $400,000) from being audited using the new IRS funding. \n\nSo explain to me this: how exactly would you differentiate between newly allocated and old funds? Because at least as you worded it here, it’s still possible to go after people but just not with new money. And to me, this is where it really doesn’t make sense from an administrative perspective. Unless they want to get rid of the IRS’s capacity to do this altogether, trying to track differences in money doesn’t really make a lot of sense and you could simply shift allocations and budgets between the two such that it probably wouldn’t matter to begin with.\n\nFrom an actual practical perspective, I think it’s highly unlikely that the IRS invests significantly more resources to going after ordinary folks who really wouldn’t bring that much in. Most of these resources are really meant to go towards auditing rich people who have extremely complicated tax returns and may use a variety of very sophisticated financial instruments and strategies to avoid paying tax. And not only that, they often have significant legal resources at their disposal. I will say to be fair, it is likely that a few more people making under $400,000 annually will be audited, but I don’t think people will have a lot of sympathy for people who are incorrectly filing their taxes regardless of how much they make. But the intent and purpose is certainly not to go after these people and more resources will let the IRS actually focus on its high priority targets which tend to be people with a lot of money and wealth.\n\n&gt; It was rejected along party lines (50-50) with Kamala being the tie breaker.\n\nGood. I mean not good that republicans voted for it, but good that it didn’t pass. \n\n&gt; What’s the potential rationale for rejecting this amendment? \n\nIt’s bad policy.\n\n&gt; Does this signal that the IRS will be coming after people making less than $400,000 which Biden promised would not be the case? \n\nNot anymore than is already the case. \n\nAlso, we totally could have a system where in the IRS simply takes what it knows about you and “does your taxes for you”. At that point, they would send you a report which would either tell you that you owe money or that you should receive a check, and at that point you can decide whether or not you want to dispute their calculations. This is the way the taxes are done in many other countries. If people are so worried about being audited, then perhaps we should look at doing this, which is some thing that many Republicans have stood in the way of or are expressly not in favor of.",

    "a": "* The Niles and Sutherland report alone is primary documentation in the U.S. record (among many others) indicating there was an Armenian revolt, that it continued through and after WWI, that Armenians attacked Muslims just as Muslims attacked Armenians, and that some wartime sources like U.S. Ambassador Morgenthau may have edited or suppressed reports in order to convey an anti-Ottoman message.\n\n* According to Armenian-American historian Richard Hovanissian, based on an official statement of the Armenian Republic, when Russian forces (including Dashnak volunteer units) relocated Ottoman Armenians to the Caucasus, 150,000 out of 300,000 perished due to lack of food and epidemics. This 50% mortality rate is similar or higher than that of many estimates of the 1915 Armenian relocation (between 40 and 50%) even though the Russian relocation didn't involve combat, as with the Armenian-Turkish conflict. Armenian official statistics also state that 50,000 of the 200,000 Armenians in the independent Armenian state perished due to epidemics in Yerevan in 1918-19.\n\n* All population figures higher than 1 million to 1.6 million were supplied by the Armenian Patriarchate or relied on it, and were presented immediately after WWI to support Armenian territorial claims during the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, Sevres Treaty, etc. Again, Richard Hovannisian agreed the prewar Armenian figures were overstated, while Muslim deaths have been understated. The inflated Armenian death tolls are calculated simply by subtracting the estimated postwar Armenian population from the estimated prewar population, and as I've written before, many if not most deaths probably were not related to combat or massacres - there haven't even been any mass graves of Armenians found to support this. Hospital records indicate the majority of Ottoman soldiers also died from epidemics and not combat. Much of the population change didn't even relate to Ottoman actions, but that's for another discussion.\n\n* Contrary to many claims, Turkey does not currently take a official position on whether or not genocide took place. Opposing politically-motivated genocide legislation and insisting on a fairer treatment of history, one that includes a far larger scale of Muslim suffering during WWI, rather than a blatantly one-sided reading, is not “genocide denial.” The Turkish government has long provided financial support to studies that claim an “Armenian genocide” took place, even those closely aligned with the Armenian narrative. The London School of Economics, for example, has been a source of such studies. There have also been people with such views paid under Davutoglu's term as prime minister. Turkey endorses third-party investigation and does not take a position since doing so could be akin to accepting legislative judgment instead of requiring alleged genocide victims to bring their case before the ICJ, as required by the UN Genocide Convention.",

(level 2) Very good if you have high production. I think the cheapest units to make are lancers and then artillery. Gift 4/5 units and the city state will be your ally. The more cities you have the better as using this policy ties your cities down. \n\n\\- Treaty Organiztion. (level 3) Easy passive city state points. 2 major downsides tho, first every trade route to a city state is a trade route you cant use for your own cities. Second, the ai sometimes prioritizes No Trade With City States in the world congress. \n\nDepending on what civ you are playing you may only need to pick one of these. E.g. if you are playing Austria then arsenal of democracy feels so good. Probably the most powerful tenant in the game for that civ. But if you are playing Venice, then treaty organization is more up your alley. A civ like Germany can go either way\n\nAutocracy:\n\n\\- Gunboat Diplomacy. (level 3) Probably the most powerful bonus. Park a couple units near a city state and get some easy passive city state points. If you can put them inbetween say 3 city states you are getting +18 city state points per turn. Very efficient. Sometimes your units do not have to even be very close. The main downside here is that you went autocracy and if you aren't constantly at war it feels kinda bad, also no culture bonuses. \n\nOrder:\n\n\\- nothing",

In their view it's okay to provide welfare to businesses but not individuals because businesses use the money to \"create jobs and things of value to society\" but not to individuals who simply \"make bad choices.\"  To them, it's okay for businesses to be forgiven for just about anything because those are the entities taking all the risk, while it's unforgivable for individuals to make less-than perfect choices for anything  (or simply be unlucky or born poor) that could burden others in the tiniest way.  It never occurs to them that they are subsidizing business missteps and greed that are constantly visited directly upon individuals.  This ends up costing taxpayers even more  for social safety nets on top of the corporate welfare while the fat cats laugh all the way to the bank.  \nAlong with this sentiment is the value of higher education equated only to its marketability in the economy.  Not only is it unreasonable to expect very young adults to predict with great accuracy the ROI of their specific type of college degree,  having a well-educated society in a wide variety of disciplines creates growth and prosperity far beyond what dollar amount a corporation places on it.",

Oh, best of all, they didn't go to the congress and spent the whole Friday afternoon locked in my room, just going out to eat out.\nIn the end, they made my room theirs, luggage and clothes everywhere, and until they left on Sunday (today), I hadn't stepped on my room. They left without talking to anyone, they organized my bed, but the moment I stepped on the room I smelled the very strong smell of his perfume on my pillow, and although I changed the sheets, the smell continued in the room.\nI complained to my family at lunch about how the smell bothered me and that even taking off the sheets the smell continued. They called me selfish because I was complaining about having to give up my room for a few nights and they were good guests, but none of them had to give up their beds or rooms, and after a whole week in another house, all I wanted was my bed, which I didn't even know was busy because no one warned me in advance and I had to swallow it, besides letting a stranger sleeping in my bed. \nAm I really making a bigger fuss than it is?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "a": "There aren't any bills that will pass the filibuster because the Reps have said explicitly that they will oppose anything that Biden proposes. Period. It's very important to understand that in the current understanding of the Republican party, there is not even a thought given to the quality of ideas, bipartisan compromise, or anything that would give the Dems a win. I mean, the Reps even flip flopped on a veteran bill they *already passed and supported* just because the Dems got a win! There are no real solutions here.\n\nAs far as what the Reps are trying to do on this issue...well they really aren't. This isn't really a part of the MAGA platform in any way, and the few Reps who do weigh in on this issue are mostly focused on question even if there is a need for college. Take a look at how many Reps are pushing trade schools, or demonizing higher education by calling it \"liberal indoctrination.\" There simply isn't a desire for the Reps to make it easier for folks to afford college--less college is simply their preferred answer to this problem.\n\nSo what are the proposals? Well, this is really the only fully-fleshed out plan for the Dems there is: [https://joebiden.com/beyondhs/#](https://joebiden.com/beyondhs/#)\n\nIs it perfect? Probably not. But there's a lot to unpack here. This isn't just an educational issue, but an economic one, too, and it intersects with other stuff. Elizabeth Warren talks about this quite a bit, including in her book *The Two Income Trap* that was written almost two decades ago now. She's been pushing for some changes to our loan and debt rules for a long time and that would certainly help, but it's hardly comprehensive to this issue. Biden's proposal here is the closest we have.\n\nBut if that's immediately DOA, which it completely is, then there really *isn't* a solution at all on the table right now. This requires complicated, nuanced legislative change and won't happen without the filibuster getting abolished or the Reps suddenly have an interest in changing their governing style back to the way it was before Newt Gingrich was speaker in the 90s. Given that situation, I'm really not surprised Biden went with the forgiveness plan that he was resistant to at first. There's literally nothing else on the table.\n\nThis is one of those issues that's pretty low on the priority list even for the party that wants to fix it. If we want to change that, we either need to vote in a filibuster-proof supermajority of Dems and leave them there for a little while to clear out the backlog of stuff that needs to get done, or we need to proposal wholesale structural reform (abolishing the filibuster!). Or we just accept the status quo. Those are our options.",

    "q": "Colorado River Compact",
    "a": "First of all, Lake Mead is a reservoir on the Colorado River. The states’ allocation is from the Colorado River - not Lake Mead. Also, there are 7 states and the country of Mexico that have allocations from the river. \n\n\nThe Colorado River Compact will never be eliminated. Each state and Mexico would have to be in agreement. That will never happen. The Bureau of Reclamation manages CO River operations and does have the ability to declare shortage conditions and reduce allocations. We are currently in tier 1 shortage and will likely enter tier 2 shortage next year. The EPA has no jurisdiction over CO River operations.\n\n\nThe Imperial Irrigation District is the single largest water user on the river. And the Imperial Valley is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the US. But, a very significant portion of that agricultural output is on forage crops for animals (e.g. alfalfa) of which a large portion of that is exported. So, yes there does need to be some reckoning about agricultural water use, but to say “we can agree” that CA should be cut off from CO River water without any understanding of basic river operations and who uses the water how is inane.",

    "a": "No, it was thought that frequent elections in the House would be sufficient to limit people who served past the time they were effective in their representation and prevent complacency and corruption. It is the rise of parties and partisan campaigning, gerrymandering, and effective mass media, that allowed representatives to become placeholders and time servers. \n\nOf course, I still agree with the founders on this, at least for legislatures. An argument for term limits on the executive, where populism, cult of personality, and abuse of power can lead to dire consequences, can be made.\n\nInstead of term limits for legislatures, I would rather limit gerrymandering, where every ten years the politicians pick their voters, rather than the other way around. At the writing of the Constitution the process was not unknown, but hadn't become the science it is today.",

I don't know how many units you had, but unless you had a fully prepared army, prob not a good idea.\n\nAlso, you were tempted to focus on science first and wait until the free great prophet arrives--but this is usually not the best way to play. If you are investing in religion at all in the game, it is better to get the most out of it early and claim good religious bonuses like work ethics or choral music. Also, since the Madrasa building is unlocked with the Theology *civic* which is on the culture tree rather than the tech tree, the overall strategy synergizes better with early faith and culture rather than early science. The Madrasa building is very powerful; it gives extra faith and also unlocked in the medieval era. Universities at turn 70-75 on standard speed is just too good and if you have some woods to chop out and with work ethics you can build it in no time. \n\nWhile you work on your religion you could have also built or chopped out a heavy chariot, which will give you good enough city combat strength when parked in the city center, while not requiring any resources. The heavy chariot can be upgraded to Mamluks cheaply later.",

    "a": "Remember that progressives in the United States are still capitalists. Elizabeth Warren is a good time example, but Bernie Sanders is also more of a Social Democrat than an actual Socialist.\n\nAs mentioned by other posters, these groups still benefit from this system - even if they purport to want to change it *cough* *cough* *Democrats*.\n\nA good example of this recently occurred in a local election. The incumbent Democratic city mayor lost a primary election to a proclaimed Socialist. There was no Republican candidate to oppose the winner of the primary (Republican candidates haven’t won an election in this city in 60 years). The incumbent Democrat, along with a judge who was a personal friend, inserted himself as an independent candidate for the general election - despite having missed the deadline to be added to the ballot.\n\nAdditionally, the city council suddenly had a commission to look into replacing the [mayor with a city manager](https://www.wivb.com/news/could-buffalo-become-a-city-without-a-mayor/) which would be an unelected position managed by the city council (think Flint Michigan).\n\nThe Democratic and Republican parties of the US are still capitalist parties and will avoid election reform in order to stymie Socialist efforts.",

THEY HOLD.\n\nLike, WHAT?????\n\nThat is, in truth, akin to the fraction of Libertarians or new conservative voters in MY District being the primary voter views our Rep stands with.\n\nTalk about ignoring the bulk of his voters for a single small percentage's agenda!\n\nHaving a semi responsive sort of progressive sometimes liberal Dem is ok compared to say Pelosi, but outside voters and groups trying to loudly force a recall or make them change their votes... to a DeSantis or Trump type agenda at that!... would be an outrage.\n\nHaving them do it on the national stage and persist for many years while claiming THEY KNOW BETTER WHAT VOTERS WANT HERE is insane.

    "a": "You know, I am no thru-hiker, not by a long shot. I occasionally day hike, that's it, with dreams like glimmers of maybe someday doing a two-week trip on some pretty part of the AT when the season isn't too godawful hot. That is to say, my opinion means very little compared to the thru-hiking community's.\n\nBut, I did have a part of my childhood and frequent adult visits to North Georgia, where my mom lived for many years, and I've day hiked parts of the Blue Ridge section of the trail a few times in my life, along with non-AT parts of the N-GA Blue Ridge mountains.*\n\nSo, the idea of the trailhead starting in Alabama instead makes me scrunch up my nose. I mean, the foothills in Alabama count as Appalachia, I *guess*, but the Blue Ridge is so incredibly scenic. I imagine the view is an excellent start to a journey, and I can imagine for N to S travellers, the sight of summertime Blue Ridge is a huge relief. \n\nIt doesn't surprise me at all that the only group pushing for the joining is the state of Alabama.\n\n*NOTE: anyone whose only ever started at the Springer trailhead, I heavily recommend maybe starting south at Amicalola falls instead. It adds maybe 8 to 10 miles total to your trip, and it's an incredibly scenic start to the BIG journey. But again, I'm just a day hiker.",

Same way the dems pushed for Biden over Bernie in 2020.  And now we have the least popular president in history.  Rock will be a solid candidate if he decided to run.

    "a": "Honestly I don't think any law passed by congress would be upheld at this point.  The court ruled that the constitution is silent on abortion so any laws pertaining to it would have to go through the states, per the 10th amendment.  I think this goes for a national ban on abortion as well as trying to codify Roe into law.  That said I think this is what the founders had originally intended with the constitution in the first place though.  The courts have expanded the role of the federal government over the years by allowing all these laws to stay around.  The federal government should have almost 0 power over the states.",

U Penn has a great page on how to access and use them, [here.](https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/cce/)\n\nFor a book published in 1933 it should have been renewed in 1961 for it to still be protected by copyright in the US.",

    "a": "* The Holocaust was explicitly backed and supported by the German state, with laws passed to enable to classification, confinement, and killing of Jews in Germany as well as an enormous bureaucratic body charged with administering the process.\n\n* The Tutsi genocide in Rwanda wasn't explicitly legalized, but it enjoyed state support, with much of the violence either being directed by the military or being carried out using supplies and weapons procured by the government for Hutu citizens to use against the Tutsi.\n\n* Lynchings in the US were not explicitly legal, but, as others have mentioned, prosecutors often used their discretion to overlook them, and in more than one case a jury refused to convict an accused murderer in the face of evidence that appears to be clear and compelling that they were guilty.\n\n* Canada's attempt at genocide through the residential schools program was supported by extensive legal frameworks and administrative bodies, which weaponized child welfare laws to deprive first nations youth of access to their own culture and history.\n\nThe fundamental truth is that the courts, just like the legislature and the executive, are an arm of the state. If the state has been set to work exterminating a people, then it is unlikely the courts of that state will intervene to stop it unless there is a significant fracture within the government, and often by the time people start dying, the courts are as complicit as anyone else is.",

    "a": "Unfortunately, that's not going to help. The CAN-SPAM Act, which is what authorizes the FTC to take action on these, specifically applies only to *commercial* messages. The FTC can't do a thing about political messages.\n\nThe FCC, on the other hand, has a separate rule restricting *some* political texts, but not all. In short, automatically dialed texts require the recipient's prior consent (which you may have provided unknowingly at some point, e.g. if you donated to another candidate). If they're *not* automatically dialed -- that is, if some real person actually sent the text -- your consent is not required. They can basically send those at will.\n\nMore info: https://www.fcc.gov/rules-political-campaign-calls-and-texts",

    "a": "\n[Message from Dr Jordan Peterson](https://jordanbpeterson.com/contact/): For the last year, I have been receiving hundreds of emails a week comments, thanks, requests for help, invitations and (but much more rarely) criticisms. It has proved impossible to respond to these properly. That’s a shame, and a waste, because so many of the letters are heartfelt, well-formulated, thoughtful and compelling. Many of them are as well — in my opinion — of real public interest and utility. People are relating experiences and thoughts that could be genuinely helpful to others facing the same situations, or wrestling with the same problems. \n\nFor this reason, as of May 2018, a public forum for posting letters and receiving comments has been established at the subreddit. If you use the straightforward form at that web address to submit your letter, then other people can benefit from your thoughts, and you from their responses and votes. I will be checking the site regularly and will respond when I have the time and opportunity.\n\n**Anyone who replies to this letter should remember Rule 2: Keep submissions and comments civil. Moderators will be enforcing this rule more seriously in [Letter] threads.**\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But as long as it's not \"3 times a day\" relapsing, I'm ok with  \n that. Once a week isn't perfect, but it's better than 20. And if I can   \ngo from 3 times a day to 1 time a week, I can go from 1 time a week to 1  \n a month, and soon enough this parasite is dead and out of my system.\n\nSorry that probably pasted awfully because I don't know how reddit works. But dude...the perfect is the enemy of the good. I think you've got a great attitude. Relapsing isn't the end of the world, because this practice will last the rest of our lives.

They miss the part where we are supposed to be stewards of the Earth. \n\nThe belief that Armageddon will bring Jesus back to the Earth to fight the devil and then there will be paradise. This means to them that the worse things gets, the closer we are to that time. Most of them also believe in the rapture, which means they also believe they won't be here when everything runs out.\n\nThese beliefs and more also lead to narcissistic attitudes towards \"the world\" which they believe they are a part of. \n\nOf course, this is could be the discourse of an extremely vocal numerical minority. I don't speak on the attitudes of individuals.",

With the vast majority of member states being second class or poor the end is always money. Those nations have little to trade so their only hope for survival comes from shaming money out of first world nations. That's where the IPCC comes in. If you look at the members of that group you'll see that most of them come from nations that A) do not pursue \"climate science\", and B) do not produce much in the way of CO2 emissions. So essentially they are people from countries that have no skin in the game other than proclaiming themselves victims. \n\nOh yes, the contributors to IPCC reports are mostly from first world countries, but those people do not produce the final reports. The reports are altered to support the political agendas of the UN members on the IPCC. A great example is the island nations of the pacific demanding and receiving money as compensation for rising ocean levels. The \"cooperation\" we see among nations for the IPCC is just another means to an end.",

    "a": "Hey, good to see the repost. This is my first Tilnin story, so let's get started.\n\n__PLOT__\n\n-Tilnin arrives at the university and finds his client's corpse, attended by a rift in the fabric between the spiritual and physical worlds. This rift appears any time a human (?) dies.\n\nThe rift is bigger because this is a murder, right? I don't see support for that in the text, but if rifts like this attract bad spirits, and appear at _every_ death, it seems like the real world would be completely overrun.\n\n-Tilnin reaches out to close the rift and realizes that a malicious spirit has already come through. He interrogates his client by unraveling his soul and taking the resulting memories.\n\nThis really caught me off guard. This spirit must be an extremely big deal to justify doing something like this. I probably can't literally call it murder, but definitely seems like an awful thing to do to someone. \n\n-He heads for the auk bones in the museum basement. There, he learns the spirit has possessed a human. He sees replicas of extinct species and we learn a little bit about the world.\n\n-Tilnin confronts the spirit, and learns that it's present by invitation. It tries to hire him. He's not really thrilled with this and attacks. It wallops him with an extinct bird and escapes with its eggs.\n\nThis part was the most interesting section for me. The partnership vs sheer possession was a nice touch. I like how the spirit believes in what it's doing, and actually offered to hire him. And then running off with the eggs tells us at least a little bit about its plans. Part of me thinks the spirit is Allison, haha. Overall, a decent opener, there are several things here to hold my interest. Also, this isn't a must-have, but unobtrusively dropping in his name at some point would be nice. \n\n__CHARACTER__\n\nTilnin seems like a good example of the classic noir archetype at this point, which leaves him operating in a pretty crowded space. The big name in magic noir is of course Dresden, with whom Tilnin has plenty of similarities. The idea of an eco-Dresden is interesting enough that I could live with it, if that was all Tilnin had going for him. While I'd still like to get a stronger sense of unique character from him here, I think I can see where you've laid the groundwork for that with one trait which really piqued my interest. \n\nAs expected, he's a bit unorthodox, more prone to physical violence than his predecessors, and happy to throw off some of their constricting rules when he thinks he can. He's also willing to be vicious when he needs to be, which was startling (though not necessarily in a bad way).\n\nEarly on, I thought he had a paradoxical dual focus on community and money. When he unravels his client's soul (chilling btw), he thinks:\n\n&gt;he hadn't hired me to guide him to the next life, and that spirit couldn't be left to roam.\n\nThat made me wonder what Tilnin would've done if the guy _had_ hired him as a guide, like was this a question of necessity or convenience? But later on, the spirit tries to hire him and he refuses. So I imagine he would've done what he considered the right thing in either case.\n\nAt first I read him as having a larger-than-average amount of self-awareness, which I thought was due to his shamanistic training. He's very aware of his own snap judgements, for instance. But as the story went on, I started to see it as more a trait of the writing style than of Tilnin himself. So now I think that was just bias on my own end, because I always love to see self-insight in a character, and I thought it was a strong choice to stand out from the pack of MCs. \n\nThe trait that I'd expect you to build on at this point is his focus on community. I really like when books have a colder setting, but some warmth around the characters to offset it (but only _some_ in this case: it's still noir). If that's where you're going with this, I think it's an excellent deviation from the pure, lone wolf noir archetype. The interplay between that and his burnout (_seen too many younger lives chewed up_) would be an interesting angle, esp. with all the stress that community must be under due to the industrial society slowly disintegrating. I imagine that he still basically works alone, but has ties that are unusual to see in this character space. It fits with the ecological aspects, too.\n\nI do have less of a sense of him being community-focused in this draft than I did in the last. But I don't think that's a bad change given what's going on - I agree that there's plenty of time later to tell us he's paid in kind, for instance (if that's still the case).",

Almost all of us are trading labour for food which ends up being mass produced just to feed us all. So saying everyone should go get in their canoe and catch a fish every meal is a bit disingenuous. If you can do that for some meals, awesome, but if you drive an hour to the fishing spot to do it you're back at square one in terms of emissions. Plus you had to buy a canoe and a paddle and a life jacket and fishing gear and that's a lot of plastic that will one day be waste. \n\nThere's no one answer and people will skew it different ways depending on the agenda, but a focus on reducing emissions overall is a good approach. Food miles add emissions, packaging adds emissions and most farmed animal products add more emissions per calorie consumed than the plant alternative. Any way you can address those helps, including carbon neutral farms so long as they are accounting for the food miles as well.",

It's a road-map, sure, but even if they didn't go into detail, they did at least mention almost every every issue that needs changing.\n\nAt times, however, it reads a bit like \"we will fix this\"; a promise with no qualifying explanation.  It sounds at times, as if they should have saved certain issues for another Agreement, the signing of which could have been ratified within this one. \n\nFor example: \"Means will be implemented to develop a policy of revalorization of the peasantry, through its various production sectors (agriculture , agroforestry, livestock, fishing, crafts) in the pursuit of food sovereignty.\"\n\nHow?   \nThe reason for the industry's initial destruction was natural disasters, but the inability to recover was caused by dependence on food aid. How can you \"revalorize\" an industry that is entirely outcompeted by foreign aid? And how do you control foreign aid without a food crisis? \n\nIn another part, mentioning the gangs, the Accords attempts to be more detailed but I think it really misses the mark here: \"To this end, the action of the armed gangs... must be contained... with a view to preventing marginalization and providing concrete responses to the problems that foster crime; exceptional measures with visible results will be studied to create jobs and improve material living conditions in areas with high population density. Justice and human rights.\"\n\nHow can any of this be done without an adequate military or police force, well armed and corruption-resistant? Gang members can't be debilitated if they're not apprehended in the first place, and there's no security without an effective body of enforcement. Why is there no mention of the need for better weaponry and safety technology for officers? Why is there no mention of police with gang ties? (often out of necessity, as they cannot afford to live in safe areas without gang presence on their officer salary). Why is there no mention of the weapons that are smuggled to gangsters from the USA, while the USA will not sell weapons to the Haitian government, resulting in often-imbalanced odds? \n\nI feel as if it remains too broad in some regards such as these, while paying attention to issues it could best leave for a second follow-up Accords (provided this one is successful) such as changing the public educational system's curriculum, working to support Haitian artists monetarily does not seem to be high in priority, but that's just me.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all, this gave me positive feelings, I'm happy to have been able to read this and I dearly hope the best for this.",

    "a": "For people saying that Americans say they want climate action but complain about having to pay high gas prices therefore they dont actually want climate action :\n\nIf we had walkable communities or good public transport in most of America do you think this would be the case ?\n\nWhere I grew up in a rural area I was a mile from a paves road and 5 miles from the nearest town with amenities and 6 miles from school.  I could bike there sometimes bx I was fairly fit, but for a kid that's a long bike ride on treacherous roads and the way back was uphill and would take an hour and totally tire me out.  It's reasonable for people that live in places like that to want lower gas prices and it's not hypocrisy for them to say they want climate action but not want to go broke driving to work or school!\n\nPlease consider that people that don't live in walkable cities with good public transit exist.  Even a lot of blue voting urban and suburban  areas don't have good walkability or public transit and have to drive places. \n\nSo it's not just rural areas, but there are plenty of pro climate action liberals or leftists in the rural areas I'm talking about, but yeah they might be a bit fucked over by high gas prices *without having electric cars or high speed rail to replace driving*.",

They went on and on about how they were my elders and knew more about these things and how I deserved what they said because of my behavior I spent my entire childhood believing every horrible thing they said about me (selfish, ruin their children's lives, waste of life, stupid, a criminal, just yelling at me for literally no reason when they are upset, fat shaming, criticizing what I wear, never good enough, worse compared to the other children in the family, etc.) because I had them up on a pedestal and had the idea that whatever they said must be the truth. I spent so much time trying to fit their mold of what they wanted for me when they would bad mouth anything I did. It took so long for me to realize that even if I did everything right they would still find something shitty to say. \n\nWhen I was still in highschool I got a part-time job (first amongst the children in my family) and kept up my grades (always above 90%) but my entire family kept shaming me and said I had to quit. Then when my boss gave me a raise because she said I did a good job my entire family proceeded to say that she was just being nice. They took out their own frustrations, jealousy, anger (my mom didn't always get along with her sister/my aunts), life problems on me and just led to believe that it was all my fault and that I deserved that.\n\nSorry for the rant but this just sparked a lot of emotions for me because I was literally made to feel like I was better off dead (actually they did say that and proceeded to defend the point saying I was a bad kid) and no one ever stuck up for me (yup my mother and father who was literally absent (lived in a different country for his job) for 15 years was in on it too) and I'm still going to therapy because despite knowing what I know it's been a recent discovery and I have years of trauma to undo.",

    "a": "Hi there,\nYou have some valid points there with plastic being needed for our ways of life. But\n\nThe problem with climate change is not only that weather will get more extreme. See intelligence is not a currency in this world, and we may think this because we are so smart, but it doesn’t buy anything and it won’t feed you. What really rules this planet is calories. To acquire calories requires to be adapted to the niche something is living in, this takes thousands if not millions of years. Rapid change to the environment means the adaptations become useless and the time it takes to adapt is too long for any species to survive a disruption to the food network on this scale. Once a species goes extinct it will not be coming back, whatever relied on it for calories will go next and this will spiral till it reaches us in the food chain.\n\nWe know what is responsible for climate change(for over 100years) and what it would take to prevent it (renewables, negative carbon emissions, etc) and what will happen if we don’t stop it. This extinction event will happen right in front of us in our lifetime and yet people keep saying ‘but I’m just one person, what can I do? I guess nothing, go on’ .  It has to start somewhere and even the smallest most seemingly insignificant thing would be better than to say ‘oh what can I do’\n\nYes everyone would need to do their part if we wanted to have a chance. The realization has haunted me ever since it dawned on me how utterly fucked we are.\n\n\nThis sell-off of fuel before it gets outlawed is exactly what is tipping the scale that must not be tipped.

Without government protecting big polluters with taxes and fees that basically give privilege to pollute and protection from class actions since \"the tax justifies the pollution\". More importantly property rights, allowing people who care about maintaing habitats and environments will help the overall situation. If someone pollutes YOUR private land (suppose you own the land to preserve the local fauna and flora) you are able to defend your property using the law, or even violence. Imagine giving absolute property right to the Amazon Forest to the native inhabitants, allowing them to protect their provate land with ALL the tool they have.\n\nif I wrote this comment on this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/w4w97e/in_b4_all_the_librights_say_uhm_ashually_we_dont/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\nshowing an extreme and simplified way (for memeing but it still make sense) to defend rhinos.\n\n&gt;Just privatize the poacher hunting business, enter in the park, pay a fee and kill as many poachers you want, make paid visit to rhinos to fund the park, and if you catch a poacher sell tickets to its stoning, people who have a premium subscription have the right to stone the poacher themselves, sell eco friendly and locally produced Rhino plushie and poacher hunter collectible cards and calendars, organize competition to attract clients, use drones to record poacher hunting and post the videos with ads to capitalize even more, with all this money help the rhino population and make it grow.\n\n\nAnarcho-capitalist approach to environmentalism",

My priority would be to narrow it down a little and you could do this by using theories. \n\nFor example, liberalism might be more interested in how media puts pressure on diplomacy (e.g. the role of media in COP Glasgow negotiations) or the differing (?) impact of media on the climate policy of democracies versus authoritarian states. \n\nRealism is more state-centric and would probably be more interested in how national interest percolates into climate negotiations through the media (?) (e.g., using natural resources as power).\n\nThe English school would be more interested in how norms are formed and acted on in climate negotiations and how the media might transform these norms (e.g., how the tragedy of the commons manifests itself in public discourse about climate policy)\n\nMarxism would seek to differentiate between developed and developing countries and finding inequalities between them and analysing the role of media and globalisation in climate policy/debate.\n\nI think poststructuralism would be interesting if you looked at the circulation of conspiracy on the internet (and endorsed by senior public officials) or how other countries have declared a 'climate emergency ' - or have not. \n\nHope these ramblings help somewhat.",

The true way to do that is to start by following the Church's various different laws rigorously (rooting out sin, attending Mass on all obligatory days, etc.) and from there, developing whatever approved prayer rule one can maintain, reading Scripture, and generally orienting one's life toward Christ. For the laity, that may not mean many, many hours of prayer per day, as one has to fulfill one's state in life before he can grow further--but it might include, say, First Hour prayer and a daily Rosary, along with a daily Bible Study, weekly confession, and Mass along with Vespers if your parish offers it.\n\nWe need to be careful not to place unofficial devotions and practices atop the official ones.",

    "a": "We're not doomed but we need to take action. Animal products (animals, their milk, etc) use more land, more water, more chemicals. 80% of our antibiotics are used on animals and that's leading our antibiotics to become less effective. Some scientists think we may not have working antibiotics in a decade or two. This will lead to millions more deaths. To grow meat, you have to grow food for the animals and have land for the animals - double the land and water. Also extra fertilizer and chemicals. This cycle leads to massive land erosion. Not to mention poop! America's cows produce 3 times more poo than all the people - and they don't use toilets! It gets in the waterways and poisons them. It raises nitrate levels in the soils which need more chemicals to make them viable again. Some people think we could go organic and have happy old western style ranches of cattle and fix everything that way. To do that for the amount of beef (just beef alone) Americans alone eat, you'd need all the land in South America, the USA and half of Canada. ALL OF IT. TLDR; Meat: It's environmentally destructive in inefficient. From a person who works in Sustainability at at university.",

But in the end, it's just an overly romanticized idea. We can't send people over without sentencing them to a cancer death. Mars doesn't have fertile soil, water, atmosphere or even valuable minerals (does it?)... Why the hell would you leave Earth, which has all that, to live buried underground, so you're not cooked by radiation, and under 0,38 m/s^2 gravity, compromising your perfectly tailored organism? It makes no sense other than to fulfill a wet dream.\n\nThough I'd really like to visit a Martian city when I'm a senior citizen. God forbid my wife passes before me, I'd even like to die there.\n\nI also really enjoy writing sci-fi about an early Martian colony, which becomes a sovereign nation or, rather, a confederacy of city-states.

    "q": "Car recycling: useful for food production - realistic or not?",
    "a": "&gt;I've been trying to find out a hack about car recycling. If I would recycle a car, how would I use it?\n\nSell the most valuable spare parts to companies that remanufacture them.\n\nSeats and tires, it turns out, are some of the more wasteful aspects of cars. Currently there's not much ability to recycle tires and polyurethane foams used in car seats, for example. Insulation on wires also turns out to be an issue as well.\n\nThere are also a fair number of engineering plastics used in cars that aren't really practical to recycle as of yet. To some extent recycled crumb rubber from tires can be used as an additive to asphalt pavement and some other applications, but that's never going to use up the supply of worn tires. \n\nIn the near future it may be practical to convert those plastic wastes into a compound called dimethyl ether (DME) by pyrolysis and catalytic reforming, which can be stored in propane equipment, and has some excellent properties for use as a diesel fuel or jet fuel. \n\nMost of the steel and aluminum in cars is already recycled as it is faily high quality scrap. \n\n&gt;Aside from this, I was thinking that the chipsets from these cars could be used to make solar panels. \n\nNot really cost effective, e-waste from cars is more valuable for the content of other metals such as copper, tin, silver, bismuth, gallium, gold, tantalum (from capacitors), and lanthanide metals from magnetics.\n\nYou can't just melt down old silicon chips and recycle them into new electronic chips or PV cells, due to the impurities. Crude silicon isn't terribly expensive. You can make it from sand and graphite. The issue is that the crude silicon needs to be converted into silicon tetrachloride which is then distilled multiple times to stupidly high purity. Then reduced back into silicon and grown into extraordinarily pure crystals then sawn into wafers.\n\nBecause of the low cost of crude silicon it's not cost effective to strip down old chips from their packaging.\n\n&gt;But anyway. Why did I do this searching? I tried to see what could be good uses of aluminum and iron. So I found out that iron (Fe+2, Fe+3, not sure) could be very useful to maintain crop health. \n\nRight. There's not really a short supply of iron compounds for fertilizer, though. Iron minerals are very abundant in the crust. You can just mix low quality iron ore from mines into bulk fertilizer.  It's just the surface soil gets depleted in certain areas due to a number of processes. Iron fertilizer can also be problematic because, usually in conjunction with phosphate, it causes toxic, lethal blooms of algae as a result of drainage that runs off agricultural land. \n\nAs I mentioned steel scrap from cars is generally high quality and is more valuable being recycled into more high quality steel. \n\n&gt;I also found out that aluminum is a good heat reflector.\n\nAmong millions of other uses. Like steel it's almost everywhere in modern society. \n\n&gt;Can I really extract iron and aluminum from a car to put this idea to practice? \n\nSure. Camshafts, timing chains, springs and rolling element bearing parts can be forged into good quality knives, if you have a forge.  Con-rods, transmission gears,  studs, are good for other items that don't need the highest hardness. \n\nYou kind of need specialized equipment to melt iron and steel though. You can't just cobble together a propane foundry from an old propane tank or something and melt steel with it. \n\nAluminum is easy to cast using many methods. Old car engine blocks, pistons, trans housings, are a good source for casting materials. You mainly want to make sure to use a degassinging flux due to the oil contamination. \n\nThese days there are people making 3D prints of clear PLA plastic, then coating them with investment casting plaster, then burning out the PLA and then refilling the resulting mold with aluminum. This is a nice way of rapid prototyping aluminum parts.  Also accessible to a hobbyist if you're willing to buy a kiln for doing the burnout step. \n\nPLA is a nice material for investment casting because it burns relatively cleanly and doesn't leave ash or char behind. \n\n&gt;I've been trying to wrap my head around this supposed solution to have a greener earth.\n\nNobody can agree what \"greener\" actually looks like though, which is where politics and salesmanship walks in and dominates the whole discussion.\n\nAluminum and steel are the two most recycled materials on earth. Steel biodegrades in a few decades. Aluminum takes longer but is generally gone in a few hundred years. If anything, car manufacturers need to use less composite parts like fiberglass or carbon fiber, and make more extensive use of aluminum to save weight. Also they should use more wood for interior paneling. \n\nIn general \"greener\" means not doing things everyone already agrees is reprehensible, like not crapping in the town water supply and not dumping acid into the air everyone breathes. \n\nSo in reality it's sales jargon for \"we finally decided to do a long term responsible thing after years or decades of widespread condemnation of our harmful short-term profiterring behavior. But we haven't stopped doing several other shitty things because they're cheap this quarter and not yet illegal.\"\n\n&gt;As we all know, the economy is getting fucked right now. \n\nI dont know what you're talking about. I'm doing pretty well, actually. There's some inherent self-serving nationalism and classism in this perception.\n\nFor about a 1/3 of earths population, nothing to see, business as usual, what economy? everything's always been too expensive. \n\nIt's a little shitty in the USA in particular because their zoning laws are warm garbage, a certain political party in that country keeps pumping money out of infrastructure spending and education and into their military, causing completely unwarranted, massive real estate inflation and unfilled construction jobs. Because it turns out you need a fair amount of knowledge and training to install electrical wiring, plumbing, ventilation,  not to mention knowing how to not violate local building codes when you put up the stick framing or prep for foundation pouring. But I digress. Also, apparently the guy temporarily in charge of their central bank is a chummy, glad-handing cigar-chomping sack of dongs with a conflict of interest. But I haven't been there for a few years. \n\nOn the other hand this is nothing compared to the chaos of first half of the 20th century, which in turn was better for the common man than almost any economic period before that time, when there was no international economic cooperation at all. If you want to say \"the economy is getting fucked,\" then just take a look at the infant mortality rate in the 19th century.  You'll realize people are doing alright for the most part, \n\nExcept in certain Asian and south American countries with bloodthirsty fascist leeches as heads of state, that are circling the drain.",

    "a": "Before people jump ship from conventional fuel to Electric only for their heat, I generally suggest taking consideration of what their electric rates are (OPERATIONAL COST), do they have any prior experience with living in a home with a heat pump (COMFORT), how cold does it normally get in the winter (COMFORT), does the electrical service have adequacy for electric heating (PREREQUISITES), and do they have a requirement for operation of the heating on generator backup power (COMPATIBILITY). If electric rates are favorable, electrical services already 200 amps or greater and checks out via a load calculation, no generator backup compatibility requirement, and temperatures don't get too crazy cold, the customers probably a candidate to go over to Electric only. \n\nI would stay with a split system, the ductwork is already set up for it, the only reason I would switch it is if there's some enormous logistical headache with putting a new air handler in the crawl space that somehow redoing the ductwork and installing a package would alleviate. That's sad, the decision that you'll need to make is whether you want a heat pump system with electric heat strips in the air handler versus a heat pump with a propane furnace as the auxiliary. It won't eliminate your propane usage but it will cut it back because the heat pump will be primary. If generator backup power is a design consideration, the propane furnace is part of the solution, whether it's the only heat source or it's the auxiliary.",

Yes, disaster lurks at every turn, but most people live uneventful lives. You can't change all the people. Laws may be enacted to mandate certain behaviours, but we all know people break laws. You do your part and lead by example. If this is your cause, get into action. You'll notice that some people who talk the most about climate change are the ones who fly private planes and live in mansions. Are they really that worried? Or do they only want you to worry until you make yourself sick?\n\nThe planet has nearly 8 BILLION people. What one person does in one place won't change what others do somewhere else. Let go of worry, since only action changes things. Ask yourself, what's the worst thing that can happen? Everyone will die. Okay, we knew that anyway.

Like solar PV and wind, continuous cost reduction will follow successful deployment and be driven, among others, by operations scale up, general improvements and new technology. To be an effective solution to fight the climate crisis, an entire carbon removal industry will need to develop over a period of the next 10-20 years, creating capacities of billions of tons of carbon removal by 2050.\n\nIf you're interested in hearing more about this topic, we can recommend the conversation about learnings from the wind industry's scale-up between our co-founder and co-CEO Jan Wurzbacher and Paul Judge, General Manager of Product Development and Quality for GE’s Onshore Wind [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKGZHyfShMg&amp;list=PLhNF3tANgni7EjBUoJxOafX-jlKHnILjk&amp;index=4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKGZHyfShMg&amp;list=PLhNF3tANgni7EjBUoJxOafX-jlKHnILjk&amp;index=4) .\r  \n\r  \nRegarding your question if providing monetary support helps us: YES! It does. Individuals were the first to purchase our service and have always been, from the time we launched our CDR service until now, a clear market signal for investors and corporate customers, which in turn, allows us to scale our plants and have a bigger impact even faster.",

My postdoc was with the Joint Genome Institute, which is with the Department of Energy, and we collaborated with many environmental scientists and other groups on not only sequencing/assembling their genomes, but also helping execute the computational side of large scale -omics projects that involved gene expression, evolution, plant-microbe interactions, optimizing yield based on growing conditions, etc. Lots of the specific genomes we sequenced were agriculture/biofuel crops or plants with specific phenotypes we wanted to understand so we can genetically engineer crops better in the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are really enjoying Comp Bio/bioinformatics part of things, I'd consider pursuing that and either work at a government lab like I did, or join a environment/agriculture lab as their resident bioinformatician. You wouldn't be the person doing field work in these cases, but instead helping plan experiments and doing the analysis for what other people bring to you. Sounds like you're pre-PhD, so most likely you'd want to look at biology/environmental sciences labs that need a comp. bio person to do your PhD in.",

    "a": "It might be at the weakest point is the last 1,000 years, but that process takes time and occurs in fits and starts. A recent study suggests it has not slowed down since 1980.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01342-4\n\n&gt;Observed SSTs and a large ensemble of historical simulations with state-of-the-art climate models suggest the prevalence of internal AMOC variability since the beginning of the twentieth century.  **Further, most of the SST cooling in the subpolar NA, which has been attributed to anthropogenic AMOC slowing, occurred during 1930–1970, when the radiative forcing did not exhibit a major upward trend**. We conclude that the anthropogenic signal in the AMOC cannot be reliably estimated from observed SST. A linear and direct relationship between radiative forcing and AMOC may not exist.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...**A relatively stable AMOC and associated northward heat transport during the past decades** is also supported by ocean syntheses combining ocean general circulation models and data, hindcasts with ocean general circulation models forced by observed atmospheric boundary conditions and instrumental measurements of key AMOC components. **Neither of these datasets suggest major AMOC slowing since 1980, and neither of the AMOC indices from Rahmstorf et al. or Caesar et al. show an overall AMOC decline since 1980**.\n\nIn general, the scientists estimate that it takes several centuries of continuously accelerating warming (the RCP 8.5 scenario) for it to be seriously at risk of collapsing, as opposed to simply slowing down further.\n\nhttps://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL070457\n\n&gt; The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report concludes that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) could weaken substantially but is very unlikely to collapse in the 21st century. However, the assessment largely neglected Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) mass loss, lacked a comprehensive uncertainty analysis, and was limited to the 21st century. Here in a community effort, improved estimates of GrIS mass loss are included in multicentennial projections using eight state‐of‐the‐science climate models, and an AMOC emulator is used to provide a probabilistic uncertainty assessment.\n&gt;\n&gt; We find that GrIS melting affects AMOC projections, even though it is of secondary importance. By years 2090–2100, the AMOC weakens by 18% [−3%, −34%; 90% probability] in an intermediate greenhouse‐gas mitigation scenario and by 37% [−15%, −65%] under continued high emissions. **Afterward, it stabilizes in the former but continues to decline in the latter to −74% [+4%, −100%] by 2290–2300, with a 44% likelihood of an AMOC collapse. This result suggests that an AMOC collapse can be avoided by CO2 mitigation**.\n\nhttps://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/39/eaaz1169.full\n\n&gt; ...To assess the impact of Antarctic discharge on future AMOC strength, we calculated the maximum overturning values throughout the full depth range of the water column in the Atlantic Ocean from 20° to 50°N. **In both RCP8.5 simulations, an almost complete collapse of the overturning circulation is seen, with the strength of the AMOC decreasing from 24 sverdrup in 2005 to 8 sverdrup by 2250. In RCP8.5FW, the collapse of the overturning circulation (based on the timing when overturning strength drops below 10 sverdrup for 5 consecutive years) is delayed by 35 years, relative to RCP8.5CTRL**.\n&gt;\n&gt; The largest difference in AMOC in these simulations corresponds to the timing of peak discharge around 2120. The stronger AMOC in RCP8.5FW may be a contributing factor to the higher SST and SAT temperatures in the North Atlantic at this time as compared to RCP8.5CTRL. **In RCP4.5FW, the strength of the overturning declines in the beginning of the run and settles into a lower equilibrium of 19 sverdrup, but it does not fully collapse**. After 2200, AMOC begins to recover in RCP4.5CTRL but remains suppressed in RCP4.5FW.\n\nMore recently, two studies suggested that it could occur even slower than that.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01328-2\n\n&gt; Freshwater (FW) forcing is widely identified as the dominant mechanism causing reductions of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a climate tipping point that led to past abrupt millennial-scale climate changes. However, the AMOC response to FW forcing has not been rigorously assessed due to the lack of long-term AMOC observations and uncertainties of sea-level rise and ice-sheet melt needed to infer past FW forcing. \n&gt;\n&gt; **Here we show a muted AMOC response to FW forcing (~50 m sea-level rise from the final deglaciation of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets) in the early-to-middle Holocene ~11,700–6,000 years ago**. Including this muted AMOC response in a transient simulation of the Holocene with an ocean–atmosphere climate model improves the agreement between simulated and proxy temperatures of the past 21,000 years. **This demonstrates that the AMOC may not be as sensitive to FW fluxes and Arctic freshening as is currently projected for the end of the twenty-first century**.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-022-00236-8\n\n&gt; Paleo-proxy records suggest that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) exhibits a threshold for an abrupt change, a so-called tipping point. A classical bifurcation theory, a basis of the tipping dynamics of AMOC implicitly assumes that the tipping point is fixed. However, when a system is subjected to time-varying forcing (e.g., AMOC exposed to ice meltwater) an actual tipping point can be overshot due to delayed tipping, referred to as the slow passage effect. \n&gt;\n&gt; Here, using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity and a low-order model with freshwater forcing, we show that the tipping point of AMOC is largely delayed by the slow passage effect. **It causes a large tipping lag of up to 1300 years, and strongly relaxes the abruptness of tipping as well**. We further demonstrate that the tipping modulation can actively occur in past, present, and future climates by quantifying the effect during Dansgaard-Oeschger events, meltwater pulse 1A (MWP-1A), and current Greenland ice sheet melting. **The suggested slow passage effect may explain the observed lagged AMOC collapse to MWP-1A of about 1000 years and provides implications tipping risk in the future**.",

But the fifth hour has arrived’—this was the hour in which he was in the habit of taking his exercise and then having a cold bath—‘so let’s go off and take some exercise.’\n\n&gt; [30] When he had completed his exercise, someone came and told him, ‘You’ve been convicted.’—‘To exile,’ he asked, ‘or to death?’—‘To exile.’—‘What about my property?’—‘It hasn’t been confiscated.’—‘Then let’s go away to Aricia and eat our meal there.’\n\n&gt; [31] This is what it means to train oneself in the matters in which one ought to train oneself, to have rendered one’s desires incapable of being frustrated, and one’s aversions incapable of falling into what they want to avoid.\n\n&gt; [32] I’m bound to die. If at once, I’ll go to my death; if somewhat later, I’ll eat my meal, since the hour has arrived for me to do so, and then die afterwards. And how? As suits someone who is giving back that which is not his own.\n\n- Epictetus, Discourses, Chapter 1.\n\nWhen you were a baby, you learned that if you felt sad enough about something, it would make you cry, and that would summon an adult. You are not a baby any more, so that strategy will not work any longer. You can make yourself as sad as you want, but all it will do is make you miserable in exchange for nothing.\n\nFortunately, you are a human, and a human can leave behind a strategy that no longer works. The question is what to replace it _with._ Well, let's start with what _not_ to do, and that's anything that keeps you in this state of mind.\n\nHave you read an article about climate change? Great! You have acquired the knowledge. If you see another article five minutes later, with a similar headline, _there is no reason to read it._ It will just be a paraphrasing of what you already know.\n\nAnd now you find yourself reading comments about climate change. If you've read ten comments expressing the same opinion about the same thing, do you need to read another 90 that are essentially the same? No, surely not. When you are dismayed about something, that's the _worst_ time to go and see how dismayed everyone else is. Misery loves company, but do you love misery? I think not. You have come here and posted this thread because you _don't_ love misery.\n\nWhat would Agrippinus think of all this if he was here today? I think he would go about his day, do precisely what is necessary in the face of this threat, and nothing more. He would not, as he said, \"become an obstacle to myself.\" He might consider who to vote for, how to take care of himself and his family; that done, he would _move on to thinking of other things._ He would not chase himself around in circles.\n\nLife is going to bring problems to you. This will happen automatically. You don't need to create more problems of your own. Stop reading the same articles that say the same thing. If you catch yourself doomscrolling and reading comments from others who are in despair, ask yourself: \"If I'm in despair, and asking not to be, then why do I only put more of the same in front of myself?\" _Stop reading that shit._\n\nThen, what can you do?\n\nThe question answers itself.\n\nFocus on what you can do. There are many things you can do that will make your life better, and increase the odds that you can look after yourself and your loved ones. Not a single one of these things involves doomscrolling. Every minute you spend on that is a minute you _don't_ spend on anything that matters.",

Maybe the mistake that is being repeated, first by the Professor and now by the Lunarians, is how their desire for the new basically means condemning others to suffer in their place.

    "a": "I talk to my wife about this pretty much every day. It's something that we are absolutely astounded at when talking about it. The average level of gardening knowledge seems like it is incredibly low. \n\nThese are all speculations. Please don't take this is fact. This is my opinion based on my own experiences.\n\nThere's inherent problems with a consumer based economy. I think the vast majority of people getting into gardening are unfortunately submerged in this idea that they **NEED** things to do it. I see so many raised garden beds. I see people suggesting fertilizers for non nutritional problems. It's just an overall influence on how people think they need to garden. \n\nFor some odd reason, it seems like people not only make raised beds for the aesthetic but also because they're convinced that their soil just isn't good enough. Why? Beats the hell out of me. Instead, they rely on importing soils to fill their raised beds. I think the gardening industry has everyone convinced that they NEED their products to be successful. You NEED Safer soap for pests, Jobe's fertilizer, Happy Frog soil and X brand tomato cages. \n\nI don't think the general public realizes that a cabbage lasts 6+ months in a cool place or that winter squash can be stored in a basement for a year. They don't know that simply putting cucumbers into salt brine can preserve them for the better part of a year. Same goes for Sauerkraut.\n\nI think before anybody can start gardening or farming on their own personal plots, they've got to find a release from the consumer system in place that convinces them they can't become experts without buying stuff. \n\nThere's a meme that pops up in r/vegetablegardening that's like \"after 6 weeks and $200, I can finally harvest a 25 cent vegetable\". Look at all the comments. It always turns into people talking about the cost effectiveness of their garden. The majority of comments allude to the fact that they aren't cost effective and posters justify it not being cost effective because it's a good hobby and good therapy. \n\nI think if everyone started gardening now, we'd find ourselves in a big wave of problems. Over fertilization is super common and people are spending way more money than they make. Importing soil requires carbon emissions. Until people realize that you can be self sufficient and cost effective on a small plot, I don't think gardening is quite the answer yet. \n\nThere's been a recent uptick in the US with aminopyralid herbicide damage in store bought plant starts. People rely on Lowes or Home Depot for tomato plants. A lot of people are finding that a few weeks after they purchase the plant, it's growing funny and not producing. This is a reliance on a system that has failed them. Starting your own tomato seeds is the most trivial of seeds in the garden. They can be direct sowed with great results. Yet, here we are. People don't have the knowledge and it seems like the consumer market around gardening is inhibiting the acquisition of knowledge in the general public surrounding gardening.",

Its that the right believes things like, the lefts policies on racism for example are counter productive to combatting racism. I don't want to delve into that topic. It's a general example. The left thinks they are the only combatting racism. The right actively combats racism. They disagree on how to combat racism. Why would they join hands with opponents who insist on creating more racism just became they also claim to be against it.\n\nFor the most part those statements hold true still if you flip the words left and right around.\n\nHowever the skewed perspective comes from the left has a grossly skewed perspective on what they believe the right believes while the opposite is less true.",

The brother and sister concepts literally belong to the mother and not to the father. For example, Amazigh people say Ot-Mma (for Sister) or Og-Mma (for Brother) meaning she belongs to my mom or he belongs to my mom respectively.  \nThroughout history, women were always responsible for the management of economic, social, cultural, or even religious matters and were a source of life and prosperity.

You really think that the same people who think shifting is some goofy TikTok trend are magically going to believe us when we tell them we've returned for an alternate reality with everything we need to save the world? Nope, you're going to end up in with a diagnosis for delusions and hallucinations rather than any kind of recognition for stopping climate change. \n\nSo first you'd have to spend all this energy trying to convince everyone that shifting is real, something I can promise will happen slowly but surely without any effort on our parts. All we'd be accomplishing is wasting our own energy talking to people who just aren't willing to listen. Have you ever tried talking to people outside of the shifting community about it? \n\nIt's torturous, at best they'll tell it's cool you can control your dreams and at worst you have people telling you're crazy, again doing way more harm than good to the individual",

I love applying theory to the art I enjoy ever since I dug into the Sopranos Autopsy as a teen, but I think you are missing the forest for the trees here. \n\nThis is a show about people, albeit mostly bird people, first and foremost- in a world very similar to ours. And people are not typically vessels or agents of pure ideology. \n\nWe all face certain climate crisis IRL, but we continue living our own little lives, with our little dreams. The alternative (that isn't just becoming a navel gazing Doomer) involves the US military snuffing us without a second thought- and what is there to do for us little birds? Tuca wants to raise a million kids and manage to get by. Bertie and Speckle have a petit bourgeois fantasy. I want to live comfortably and safely, which is difficult as a disabled person under capitalism, but is my current reality. Normal people stuff. It is why I disagree with your initial post too; regardless if you \"approve\", sex work is a thing people do, and the show depicts it.\n\nAgain, the reading is... fine, in a vacuum. It is more useful as a thought experiment than a critique. I don't understand seeing it as a flaw, rather than the nature of what Tuca and Bertie is. To fulfill what you desire is a different beast entirely.\n\nYou can be Marxist and understand the idea of people finding it difficult to dream of revolution, instead seeking solace under the boot.",

Consider how much data science is involved in understanding the problem. Consider how robotics is going to play a role in all this. Or new manufacturing techniques involving new control systems and 3D modeling and firmware. Consider how logistics software impacts energy usage.\n\nEtc, etc.\n\nBasically everything humans do anymore involves software. If you want to help deal with climate change, find companies dealing with climate change and take a software job with them.\n\nHint: the scientists who understand the problem in terms of physics or chemistry often suck at writing software to investigate it, analyze it, visualize it, and make solutions to it practical.",

He has since written more than a dozen books and penned more articles than even he can count. He is a popular speaker at climate events and in 2008 McKibben launched 350.org which has chapters across the country and around the world. And as he tells Green TV’s Betsy Rosenberg, his latest project comes in the “Third Act” which is the name of his newly launched effort to fight climate change. This time his organizing focus is on the 60 and over set, a heretofore under-utilized demographic...\" \\~ Betsy Rosenberg \n\nhttps://youtu.be/Vb\\_KjgPO4GU",

Love ya philly, but you’ll never change.   \n\n\nchicago also has a problem with corruption and government never improving anything. New York is special for a northern city. Yeah, they steal like crazy but they also run a pretty decent city. If you want to live in nyc you need to make insane amounts of money.  chicago actually has decent housing options across a lower price band, so that’s chill. It also has a lot going on. Philly is happy to be philly. Philly was the biggest once and is ok with that. Chicago has a chip on their shoulder about New York, in a productive way.\n\nthey have all four seasons. Even winter, which is stupid, but you do you.\n\nChicago does have a crime problem. In certain areas. It sucks. The city probably won’t improve it. Don’t go to them? Chicago is also dog whistle for other words and some media is at war with it. So there’s some truth to the reputation, but it has less crime than Tennessee. Watch out for corn fields, super dangerous apparently.\n\nChicago is walkable. So that’s good for you.\n\nIt’s a really big lake. You’re senses won’t know it’s not the coast.\n\n1700 is doable in Chicago. It’s not in Manhattan or even a lot of the outer Burroughs. But you know this, which is why you’re in philly.\n\nthere’s only one New York. Just one. Sorry, it’s a world of suburban sprawl and dense and up was bad for the economy for decades. We only built one. Either make enough that col isn’t an issue or don’t compare where you end up to how much New York has going on.\n\nwhen philly seems small, it’s clear New York warps you.

    "a": "Jaded MS in Geography in the US here, so take this with a grain of salt. In my opinion, the single best thing you can do for your career is look at job postings for jobs you like and see what they want. Those are the people you need to convince of your competence, so jumping through their hoops is the best bet - it's like seeing the questions on a test before you start studying for it. If you're not sure what you want to do, go with the most transferrable (which imo is the hardest science you're interested in).\n\nThis is going to be true for almost any job: the harder the science, the more transferrable the skills. Your general geography degree won't necessarily prepare you for complex geologic field sampling, but the geochemistry you studied in Chem class will help you understand the geography of a region shaped by chemical erosion. The knowledge transfers one direction but not the other, if that makes sense. Nearly any US federal job posting in conservation will bear this out - they want biologists who know GIS rather than geographers who likes animals. Why? 1) Because GIS is easier to learn than organic chemistry. 2) Because the fine scale explains the coarse scale, but the coarse scale might gloss over the fine scale. So learn the fine scale aka the harder science.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem I see with degrees like sustainability or climate change is that they're ultimately pretty soft sciences that offer breadth without the depth to make you an asset to a specific job. At the graduate level and industry, it's no longer about knowing what needs to be done - it's about actually doing it.\n\nA broad degree like Sustainability or Climate Change may equip you to tangle with the topic over an interview table, but the most meaningful contributions to either research or industry will come if you can do the work itself. And unless you're working in policy, that means you need to know the specific science in enough depth to apply it to a complex, real-world community where the broad/global-scale knowledge is only somewhat relevant. In other words, undergrad is about learning the theory and the caveats/exceptions, while industry and grad school are about working to make the theory function in those caveated/excepted regions.\n\nStudying hydrology, soil science, or even chemistry or biology would equip you to do the work of conservation better than a degree like sustainability, in my opinion. Geology's relevance to conservation will depend highly on the program and the species you're interested in conserving, but will generally be less applicable imo (unless we're talking pikas and rock glaciers or a soil science/hydrology-intensive curriculum). But again, check the specific posting instead of listening to me ramble at vague notions on the internet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll that said, getting a job is often more about networking than knowledge, so the Ivey League school might give you an extra leg up in that department.  \n\n\nGood luck with your journey!",

I know EXACTLY how you feel and have been through similar situations. \n\nI went to therapy and still didn’t hold my narc mom, narc aunts, and narc grandmother accountable. I have spent nine years working on relationships with them and this year have finally given myself permission to call it, and walk away. \n\nIn general (props to the super tiny percent of narcissists who want to fix themselves) they don’t have genuine remorse and want to change… that would require them having empathy and seeing anything they do as wrong. \n\nThey do however know how to manipulate a situation to make it seem like they’ve changed or that there’s a glimmer of hope. And that’s how they keep you in their web and keep the cycle going. \n\nIf I knew then what I know now I would absolutely be having a wedding without my whole family there, just the few who aren’t abusive. \n\nGet into trauma informed therapy with someone who understands narcissist parents. Otherwise therapy can make things worse especially going with your abusive parent to therapy, which I’ve done and was pointless. \n\nYou and your fiancé can go to his parents and explain that you’re unpacking a lot of childhood abuse and therefore have complicated relationships with your parents and that they aren’t all safe to be around right now. \n\nIf you have close relationships with an aunt or cousin who is safe and believes you and doesn’t try to patch things up between you and your mom &amp; is more concerned with your feelings than doing her bidding- see if they can be a stand in for the parents in the parts of the wedding ceremonies and traditions. \n\nThere is no reason why you should be alienated from your culture and having a meaningful wedding IF that’s what you want just because your parents’ best attempt at parenting was still wildly abusive. \n\nHonor your culture but honor yourself more. \n\nYou’re worthy of fighting for and protecting.",

Cases continue to fall moderately. Our case average is in-line with early April, when cases were on the rise. Overall, things seem pretty quiet. I guess that's good? The situation may change later this year, as the weather gets colder, but also as the Omicron booster becomes available.\n\nAs always, please stay healthy and safe! Great job getting vaccinated, and please get your booster if you're eligible!\n\n**Fun fact:** On August 22, 1950, officials of the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) accept Althea Gibson into their annual championship at Forest Hills, New York, making her the first African American player to compete in a U.S. national tennis competition. Though she once brushed off comparisons to Jackie Robinson, the trailblazing Black baseball player, Gibson has been credited with paving the way for African American tennis champions such as Arthur Ashe and, more recently, Venus and Serena Williams.

He may have associated walking (which you mentioned was a new skill) with his legs hurting and he doesn’t want to do it right now because he things it will hurt. OR he remembers that knee walking is faster for him and doesn’t want to practice the walking. I would look at the pain association first, and talk about his legs, ask about when they were sore or if they are, give a nice bath with epsom salt, and maybe rub some magnesium lotion on his legs (or whatever lotion you have available and call it “owie medicine” for his legs) then ask him if he feels better. If that doesn’t work, try coming up with some games where the rules are standing on feet and walking… tag, races, soccer, things like that. Ask him help you with things that he has to stand to reach and then WALK them back to you. Make a big deal when he WALKS back! “Oh thank you for WALKING that over to me! You walked really well! Can you walk to get (item) for me and walk it back, please? That would really help me!” That type of encouragement always worked with my daughter and she was so proud of herself that she kept doing it. “Look, mommy, I’m WALKING to my room!” \n\nDon’t be so hard on yourself, it’s so easy to fall into the mommy guilt trap, ESPECIALLY around topics where so much harmful misinformation has been spread.

I enforced the mandate and confronted customers who were putting us at risk and had to deal with them physically threatening me for asking them to please wear a mask for five minutes at checkout to protect our cashiers. I was taken off of the management track for being a shit stirrer. I was vocal about how they never informed anyone of exposure and allowed sick people to work. Not seeing my family for an entire year because my parents are high risk. Losing friends to fake news and the disease. \n\nSo yes, you can get PTSD from the pandemic. I still have nightmares about crowds of people like a horde of zombies surrounding me and I can't escape. It's been a long road to getting stable enough to leave my house for anything non essential and enjoy my life again. \n\nI truly don't enjoy being around people in general now and it makes me sad.

    "a": "This post has reached one of our comment/karma limits. The text of the post has been preserved below.\n\n---\n\nLong story short. Well maybe not that short. \n\nWhen the COVID vaccine became available, my husband and I got  the first dose. My husband heard the side affects for men were higher with the 2nd dose, was afraid he would get sick and would have to miss work. He never ended up getting the 2nd dose. \n\nSince then he’s jumped on the anti-COVID vaccine bandwagon. He’s been on it for a year and a half arguing it’s unsafe and has caused so many people health problems which is information he got from Google. He’s also concerned about the long term effects. It also doesn’t help that the rest of his family have refused to get it also.\n\nI work in clinical research. My company actually helped run the clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine. No matter what I say, he doesn’t believe it. \n\nFast forward to today. He’s been looking for a new job because he’s hated his current job terribly for the last 2 years. I’ve been helping with this. \n\nI applied to a position with a hospital group here in our area for him. The job is not medical related but is in a hospital. It is better pay, better benefits and is a way better job than he’s had in a while. I admit it didn’t occur to me when I applied that they would probably have this requirement. \n\nHe went to the interview and discussed the vaccine several times. I thought well that’s it, they’re not going to hire him. A few days later he was offered the job. HE WANTS THE JOB. However, you know what the problem is after reading this I’m sure. They are requiring him to get the vaccine again and he’s refusing to do it. They do offer a medical exemption or a religious one. \n\nSo what’s his plan? He has a friend that’s a physician that he’s hoping will help him out with a medical exemption. I’ve read the form and the hospital group wants proof. There is no proof the doc can provide. If this doesn’t work then he’s just going to turn down the job. \n\nI’m furious. I’m pretending to be ok with that decision but I think it’s ludicrous. He can tell that I’m trying to use reverse psychology to get him to just go get the damn vaccine and he says I’m being selfish. He said his health is more important. \n\nI just can’t understand how he could pass this great opportunity up. He had one vaccine already and was ok. \n\nI don’t know what to do except to accept there is nothing I can do. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice?",

The cities, buried under a thick layer of volcanic material and mud, were never rebuilt and largely forgotten in the course of history. In the 18th century, Pompeii and Herculaneum were rediscovered and excavated, providing an unprecedented archaeological record of the everyday life of an ancient civilization, startlingly preserved in sudden death.

In fact, when you look at those same areas, the individual places with bars on the window have less crime than the places without bars on the windows.\n\nThis feels to me like a version of Simpson's Paradox, where trends from large-scale data obfuscate the actual trends at a more precise level of data.",

    "a": "1) Even if all the Hunter Biden conspiracy theories were true, it wouldn't really matter, because he is a private citizen. I mean what's the story here exactly? \"Rich politician uses his influence to help get his son a high-ranking job, and that son likes to party with cocaine and hookers\" isn't exactly anything groundbreaking as far as I'm concerned.\n\nAlso, we know that it's bullshit, because the main conspiracy theory surrounding the laptop was that a Ukranian official wanted to investigate Hunter, and Joe put pressure on the government to have him canned. However, we have plenty of evidence from the EU and the IMF indicating that that official was corrupt himself, and that he was in fact too lenient in his investigations into large corporations, and that the decision to withold aid was a bipartisan decision made by the federal government, which hardly involved Biden. This story isn't even worth the time it took me to write about it.\n\n2) That Bill Gates clip was taken out of context. Here's an article if you're interested. https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-coronavirus-gates-idUSL1N2S7292\nBasically, he was talking about preparedness for future pandemics, and the budget we need to invest into R&amp;D for better technologies, including vaccines. He mentioned that while the COVID vaccines were great at saving lives, they weren't as effective in preventing transmission, which is true when you consider how effective these vaccines were against Delta and other variants. The problem is that the left was worrying about this exact thing since the pandemic started, we knew that the virus could mutate, and become resistant to our vaccines, which is why we advocated for taking the steps necessary to control the virus, and keep its transmission aa low as possible. It's not our fault the right-wing likes to lick door knobs.\n\nThe problem with addressing every claim the right makes is that there literally aren't enough hours in the day to do so, and it's best for us to focus on ways we ca make the people's lives better, and winning the vote that way, rather than getting bogged down in the deranged right-wing conspiracy theory of the day.",

    "q": "Article from die Welt, about vaccine sideeffects, former BKK Vitae CEO Schöfbeck was interviewed about reporting concerns (then he got fired)",
    "a": "German:  \n\nArtikel aus der Welt (Februar 2022), über Impfstoff-Nebenwirkungen berichten:\n\nEine Analyse von Millionen von Versichertendaten der Betriebskrankenkasse BKK kommt bei den Nebenwirkungen zu deutlich höheren Zahlen als das Paul-Ehrlich-Institut.\n\nDie neuen Daten sind ein \"Alarmsignal\", sagt BKK-Vorstand Andreas Schöfbeck.\n\nErstmals liegen Zahlen eines großen deutschen Krankenkassenverbands zu Nebenwirkungen von Covid-Impfstoffen vor. BKK ProVita-Vorstand Andreas Schöfbeck ließ die Daten von Millionen von Versicherten der BKK-Gruppe auswerten. Demnach ist die Gesamtzahl der Nebenwirkungen um ein Vielfaches höher als die vom Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI) gemeldeten. In einem Videotelefonat mit der WELT sagte Schöfbeck am Mittwoch: \"Die ermittelten Zahlen sind erheblich und müssen dringend auf Plausibilität geprüft werden.\"\n\nLaut Schöfbeck ist die BKK ProVita auf die steigende Zahl von Diagnosen im Fallmanagement der Krankenkasse aufmerksam geworden, die auf Impfnebenwirkungen hinweisen. Deshalb wurde der gemeinsame Datenpool aller BKK-Krankenkassen nach den Diagnoseschlüsseln T88.0 (Infektion nach Impfung/Sepsis nach Impfung), T88.1 (Sonstige Komplikationen nach Impfung, Ausschlag nach Impfung), Y59.9 (Komplikationen durch Impfstoffe oder biologisch aktive Substanzen) und U12.9 (Unerwünschte Wirkungen bei der Anwendung von Covid-19-Impfstoffen) durchsucht.\n\nDas Ergebnis: Von Anfang 2021 bis Mitte des dritten Quartals seien 216.695 BKK-Versicherte wegen unerwünschter Ereignisse, die durch Impfstoffe verursacht wurden, behandelt worden. Ausgeschlossen seien 7665 Fälle von Komplikationen durch andere Impfstoffe. Etwaige Mehrfachbehandlungen von Versicherten wurden in der Statistik nicht berücksichtigt - sie wurden pro Patient berechnet.\n\nIm Vergleich dazu verzeichnete das Paul-Ehrlich-Institut bis zum Stichtag 31. Dezember 2021 nur 244.576 Meldungen von unerwünschten Ereignissen, die durch Covid-Impfstoffe ausgelöst wurden, basierend auf 61,4 Millionen Impflingen. \"Unsere Analyse zeigt, dass wir es hier mit einer erheblichen Untererfassung zu tun haben\", sagt Schöfbeck. Er weist darauf hin, dass die von ihm und seinem Team analysierten Daten nur 10,9 Millionen Versicherte und nur einen Zeitraum von siebeneinhalb Monaten umfassen; die Impfkampagne läuft in Deutschland bereits seit 14 Monaten.\n\n\"Starkes Warnsignal\" \"Nach unseren Berechnungen halten wir 400.000 Arztbesuche unserer Versicherten aufgrund von Impfkomplikationen bisher für realistisch\", sagt Schöfbeck: \"Hochgerechnet auf die Gesamtbevölkerung wären es drei Millionen.\" Wie erklärt er sich den Unterschied zwischen PEI- und BKK-Daten? Schöfbeck führt das Meldesystem als Problem an: \"Die Ärzte werden für die Meldung von Impfschäden nicht bezahlt. Gleichzeitig ist dieser Prozess sehr zeitaufwendig. Es ist schlicht unmöglich, alles zu melden.\" Über Art und Schwere der Beschwerden lasse sich anhand der Datenlage keine Aussage treffen, sagt Schöfbeck: \"Klar ist nur, dass es den Leuten so schlecht ging, dass sie zum Arzt gegangen sind.\"\n\n\"Viele werden sich fragen, ob bei der Impfung etwas falsch gemacht wurde.\"\n\nSchöfbeck hat sich in den vergangenen Tagen an verschiedene Institutionen gewandt, darunter die Bundesärztekammer, die Kassenärztliche Vereinigung, den GKV-Spitzenverband und die Ständige Impfkommission (Stiko). Das Schreiben an den PEI-Präsidenten Paul Cichutek ist überschrieben mit dem Thema \"Schwerwiegendes Warnsignal für verschlüsselte Impfnebenwirkungen nach Corona-Impfung\". Darin erklärt der Verfasser, dass die neuen Zahlen \"als deutliches Alarmsignal zu werten sind, das bei der weiteren Anwendung der Impfstoffe unbedingt berücksichtigt werden muss.\" Er erwartet schnelle Antworten, da eine \"Gefahr für das menschliche Leben\" nicht auszuschließen sei.\n\nSchöfbeck ist seit 21 Jahren Vorstandsmitglied der BKK Pro Vita mit Sitz in München. Der Krankenkassenbetriebswirt sagt, er fühle sich seinen Versicherten verpflichtet. Deshalb macht er die Daten öffentlich: \"Die Zahlen, die sich aus unserer Analyse ergeben, sind sehr weit von den öffentlich verkündeten Zahlen entfernt. Es wäre ethisch falsch, nicht darüber zu sprechen.\"\n\nAuch der Medizinstatistiker Gerd Antes ist alarmiert: \"Der Staat und das Gesundheitssystem sind in der Pflicht, diesen Missstand schnell aufzuklären. Der größte Schaden, der entstehen kann, ist die Schädigung der Impfbereitschaft\", so der ehemalige Direktor des Deutschen Cochrane-Zentrums gegenüber der WELT.\n\nVom Paul-Ehrlich-Institut war bis Redaktionsschluss keine Stellungnahme zu erhalten.\n\nARTIKEL ENDE\n\nSchönbeck wurde gefeuert, nachdem er berichtet hatte, dass die offiziellen Statistiken extreme Probleme mit Underreporting haben und im Vergleich zu seinen Daten, die offiziellen Berichte nicht richtig erscheinen.\n\nLink zum ersten PDF imgur\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/huvmjOB\n\n(die Formatierung war viel besser, bis reddit beschloss, mich zu fi...)\n\n\nDer offizielle Brief Schönbecks an alle deutschen Instanzen:\n\nSchwerwiegendes Warnsignal für verschlüsselte Impfnebenwirkungen nach Corona-Impfung\n\nSehr geehrter Herr Prof. Dr. Cichutek, das Paul-Ehrlich-Institut hat per Pressemitteilung mitgeteilt, dass für das Kalenderjahr 2021 244.576 Verdachtsfälle von Impfnebenwirkungen nach der Corona-Impfung gemeldet wurden.\n\nDie unserem Institut vorliegenden Daten geben Anlass zu der Vermutung, dass es eine starke Untererfassung von Verdachtsfällen nach der Corona-Impfung gibt. existiert.\n\nEine Auswertung dazu lege ich meinem Schreiben bei. Die Datengrundlage für unsere Auswertung sind ärztliche Abrechnungsdaten. Unsere Stichprobe wird aus dem anonymisierten Datensatz der Betriebskrankenkassen gebildet. Die Stichprobe umfasst 10.937.716 Versicherte. Bislang liegen uns die Abrechnungsdaten der Ärzte für das erste Halbjahr 2021 und etwa die Hälfte für das dritte Quartal 2021 vor.\n\nUnsere Abfrage umfasst die gültigen ICD-Codes für Impfstoff-Nebenwirkungen. Obwohl wir noch nicht über die vollständigen Daten für 2021 verfügen, hat diese Analyse gezeigt, dass wir auf der Grundlage der vorliegenden Zahlen bereits 216.695 behandelte Fälle von Impfstoffnebenwirkungen nach der Corona-Impfung aus dieser Stichprobe geschätzt haben.\n\nWenn man diese Zahlen auf das gesamte Jahr und auf die Bevölkerung in Deutschland hochrechnet, sind wahrscheinlich 2,5-3 Millionen Menschen in Deutschland wegen unerwünschter Nebenwirkungen nach der Corona-Impfung medizinisch behandelt worden.\n\nWir halten dies für ein erhebliches Alarmsignal, das bei der weiteren Verwendung von Impfstoffen berücksichtigt werden muss. berücksichtigt werden muss. Die Zahlen können unseres Erachtens relativ einfach und kurzfristig validiert werden, indem die anderen Kassenarten (AOKs, Ersatzkassen etc.) um eine entsprechende Auswertung der ihnen vorliegenden Daten gebeten werden. Hochgerechnet auf die Zahl der Geimpften in Deutschland bedeutet dies, dass etwa 4-5% der Geimpften wegen Impfnebenwirkungen medizinisch behandelt wurden.\n\nAus unserer Sicht gibt es eine erhebliche Untererfassung von Impfnebenwirkungen. Es ist ein wichtiges Anliegen, die Ursachen dafür kurzfristig zu ermitteln. Unsere erste Vermutung ist, dass, da für die Meldung von Impfnebenwirkungen keine Vergütung gezahlt wird, die Meldung an das Paul-Ehrlich-Institut wegen des hohen Aufwands häufig unterbleibt.\n\nÄrzte haben uns berichtet, dass die Meldung einer vermuteten Impfnebenwirkung etwa eine halbe Stunde dauert.\n\nDas bedeutet, dass 3 Millionen Verdachtsfälle von Impfstoffnebenwirkungen etwa 1,5 Millionen Arbeitsstunden von Ärzten erfordern.\n\nDas wäre fast die Jahresarbeit von 1.000 Ärzten. Dies sollte in der gleichen kurzen Zeit geklärt werden.\n\nEine Kopie dieses Schreibens wird deshalb auch an die Bundesärztekammer und die Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung gesandt. Auch der GKV-Spitzenverband erhält eine Kopie dieses Schreibens mit der Bitte, entsprechende Datenauswertungen bei allen Krankenkassen einzuholen. Da eine Gefährdung von Menschenleben nicht ausgeschlossen werden kann, bitten wir Sie um Ihre Rückmeldung zu den getroffenen Maßnahmen bis zum 22.2.2022 18:00 Uhr. Mit freundlichen Grüßen Andreas Schöfbeck Vorstand Dieses Schreiben ist auch zu richten an: GKV-Spitzenverband Bundesärztekammer Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung Ständige Impfkommission BKK-Dachverband\n\nENDE DES BRIEFES\n\nBearbeiten für Formatierung und Links.\n\nmein erster Beitrag dazu\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/tce69n/where_is_your_evidence_reeeeeee111/\n\ndieser Text ist der, der hinter der Paywall ist.",

    "a": "Been over 6 weeks at this point, close to 45 days.  Very little improvement, the past week has seen negative progress.  My psychiatrist is exceedingly unhelpful.  Her response to a very clear mental health emergency is to simply start me on another SNRI that takes months to reach full effectiveness.  \n\n\nOther than the temporary low dose lorazepam prescription she gave me with on refill she hasn't exactly done much to help.  \n\n\nThinking of getting a full panel blood test for everything.  Vitamin deficiencies, sickness and disease, organ failure, goddamn STDs even, I don't care, I need some kind of answers.  There has to be some kind of obscure deficiency or anomaly that could give me something to work with.\n\n  \nMy psych wants to see my in 3 weeks.  3 fucking weeks.  How on earth am I supposed to live with this for another 3 weeks just so she can be unhelpful in person?  I might need her to approve my request for blood work and other tests but she won't do anything more over the phone and I don't know what to do in the mean time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeriously, at this rate, I will start buying and trying every supplement under the sun if it helps me find the slightest bit of relief.  This is beyond miserable, it's unlivable.  I don't know what is so hard for people to fucking understand about that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI swear to got if I hear one more person tell me to \"stay positive\" and to \"get some sun\" or \"do something I enjoy\" I am going to lose it.  I \\*LITERALLY\\* cannot think positive thoughts, and it is outright impossible for my to enjoy things I used to.  Everything I think of is negative, no matter what it is, no matter the context, whether it makes the slightest bit of sense or not.  \n\n\nThis isn't some \"state of mind\" bullshit.   \n\n\nPeople don't seem to understand that this type of panic and anxiety is not normal for me.  Not only that, but it isn't caused by circumstance.  It is clinical.  I freak out and obsess over stupid things because my body and brain force me too, not because I get myself worked up.  If I somehow manage to work some panic loop into a resolution, it is either immediately replaced with some other anxious that, or I find some other angle I hadn't thought of before that starts another panic loop.  Either that, or it just restarts on it's own and no amount of rational thought can fix it.  \n\n\nNo matter how hard I try to avoid intrusive and negative thoughts, to dismiss triggers, to avoid all possible stress, best case scenario I feel like shit in general.  There is always this black background noise that taints everything I experience.  At my best, I am just angry and irritable and bothered by stupid things.  Even then, it still feels like a struggle to avoid a full blown panic attack, whenever it is I am lucky enough not to wake up with one like I have been.  \n\n\nIt isn't normal.  There is very clearly something physically and dramatically wrong with me, with my brain, that was completely absent less than 2 months ago.  \n\n\nInstead of treating this like a regular mental illness case, why can't we just try and figure out WHAT THE ACTUAL PROBLEM IS?  What is the CAUSE?  Why did I develop a serious mental illness quite literally overnight one day?  Everyone just says \" there's a lot we don't know about covid blah blah blah \" and use that line of thinking to simply dismiss horrible health issues and side effects people have been experiencing.  \n\n\nHow about we figure out what changed, and how to reverse those changes?  You can't just treat this like a normal mental illness that you were born with and grew up with.  That's entirely different.  If I had a fucking stroke the solution wouldn't be some bullshit anti-depressant that takes a thousand years to do anything (that also is totally miserable to get onto and get used to before you can even be sure if it helps or if there are horrible side effects, and if it doesn't work, it's equally miserable and time consuming to get back off of again.)  \n\n\nMaybe we should actually work on it?  You know, like proper research, with funding, and enough personnel and equipment and studies to produce proper results?  \n\n\nI swear to god this is just another lead-paint generation type of problem accept nearly everyone in the world could be affected by it.  We can't just ignore the fact that there are millions of people that have developed sudden neurological issues that range from crippling to absolutely horrifying.  \n\n\nSolving this should be a priority, so why isn't it?  Why should I have to suffer because my species is so fucking incompetent?  Why can't we ever just deal with problems before they destroy millions of lives?  Why does it always have to be after the worst happens that we even make an effort?",

What we do is pay for the testing and administer it ourselves at the door (I go out to her car when the weather's bad, she hangs out on the porch when the weather's good).   I wouldn't trust her to administer the self-test on her own...not because she's not trustworthy, but because people (especially people who've decided to 'move on') forget sometimes or rush it. \n\nif cases drop by a crazy amount in your area, you can test at the start of the week or just  a few times a week. \n\n&gt;I feel as if I were to ask her to wear a mask all week\n\ni would do this only when cases are high in your area and tell her that. that way it's not a forever thing, it's a thing you do when there's increased risk. if she protests, you can remind her that once your kid is vaccinated it'll be a different story (presuming it will be, don't lie to her if you don't know what your comfort level will be post-vax). \n\n&gt;and her belief that children don't get COVID could potentially make it difficult to reason with her if I even wanted to. \n\ni agree. ultimately, you're the boss. you cannot control what she does outside of work, but you are well within your rights to set ground rules about health in your own home, and as the employee she has to obey them. if she doesn't want to, she'll quit. \n\nbut to be honest, that may not be a bad thing. you want someone who can follow your rules whether she understands them or not. what if you had a pool in your yard -- would she follow your rules around pool safety? what if your kid has an allergy, can she follow your rules around food prep? you might as well find out sooner rather than later.\n\n&gt; Do I consider myself lucky that she's willing to test\n\nPresuming this issue is limited only to Covid and not other health and safety issues, yes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Are there other things that I should ask for?\n\n* Ventilate your living spaces if you're not doing that already. Upgrade your filters to merv-13 if you have hvac, buy some air cleaners if you don't.  \n* Upgrade your sick policy. I've written it into my contract that she's forbidden from coming to work sick without calling me first. It's also written into the contract that I have to warn her if my kid is sick so she can make a decision about coming into work. Finally, she also gets unlimited paid sick days (she has yet to use a single one except for the occasional doctor's visit). Turns out this is enough of a perk for her to be happy to be subjected to as much covid testing as we want.",

    "a": "First off we don't know that the vaccines are safe there isn't enough data to know that. Not sure if you remember but the MMR vaccine was tied to autism in children and was determined to be safe. So let's quit pretending like the government knows everything and won't lie to us. They literally lied to us about masking so that they could get the masks to the people they felt like needed them the most. Sorry but if you are willing to lie to me about that to benefit someone else why would I trust you in the rest of it?\n\nAs far as the rest of this goes I am a firm believer in my body my choice as a general rule. You do you and have fun doing it. Where that ends though is when you start to hurt other people because of it. So abortion always leads to the death of another person which is why my body my choice doesn't extend to it. I do find it extremely hypocritical though that a lot of the people that support masking and vaccine mandates also will say my body my choice and the reason they support the vaccine and masks is because they have an effect on others and could possibly kill someone. Why does your body your choice allow you to kill someone in the womb but not potentially kill someone outside of it?  This is in a time where states like California are decriminalizing knowingly infecting people with aids.",

As usual, there is a spike in hospitalizations but this usually happens on Mondays and we should see corrections come in over the rest of the week. Though cases are considerably lower than the peak (36% or so), we're still at levels higher than Delta last year or previous waves. I continue to keep hearing about people finally catching COVID, though thankfully many cases are on the milder side now. Vaccinations and boosters are a large part of why that's happening.\n\nAs always, please stay healthy and safe! Great job getting vaccinated, and please get your booster if you're eligible!\n\n**Fun fact:** On July 25, 1978, Louise Joy Brown, the world’s first baby to be conceived via in vitro fertilization (IVF) is born at Oldham and District General Hospital in Manchester, England, to parents Lesley and Peter Brown. The healthy baby was delivered shortly before midnight by caesarean section and weighed in at five pounds, 12 ounces. Today, IVF is considered a mainstream medical treatment for infertility. Hundreds of thousands of children around the world have been conceived through the procedure, in some cases with donor eggs and sperm.

Clinical volunteering is important because it shows adcoms that you know what it’s like to interact with patients and that you’ve gained an understanding of what medical professionals, especially physicians, do for their job. You need to prove that you know what kind of career you’re getting into and that you’re still passionate about it. Unfortunately, your pre-med/non-med clubs can’t substitute those experiences. The professional skills you’ve gained are great, but they don’t make a strong case for why you’d be a good candidate to become a doctor.\n\nI don’t think you need to get a license, but you should look into shadowing and volunteering at a local hospital, or volunteering in a free clinic if your campus runs one.",

So get that outta your head, kook. We are humans, our bodies do weird things. It’s okay, you are okay. You sound like such a warm beautiful soul just from this short post, and my heart hurts that you’re going through so much. I am newly graduated with a masters degree in physician assistant studies and will shed light where I can.  \n\nThe genital pain definitely sounds like a nerve problem. Have you ever been in an accident or anything where your spine/neck may have been injured? Possibly a compressed nerve causing referred pain? Did it begin post HIV? Post HSV? Do you get HSV outbreaks in relation to the stabbing, burning pains?  (If you are having frequent HSV outbreaks and have not already done so, I would recommend a daily maintenance dose of an antiviral (Acyclovir) to help reduce, and even eliminate, symptoms.)\n\nEyes - Do you have an ophthalmologist? Sometimes stye’s need to be surgically removed. A quick and easy procedure. \n\nEar and chest symptoms sound related to post-COVID issues and/or allergies. Do you have a history of allergies, seasonal or contact? Any history of asthma? Eczema?  It could also be a cerumen impaction, fancy word for blocked ear wax. Have any of your doctors looked in your ears? (Don’t use q-tips to remove anything yourself. You can use over the counter Debrox to help loosen any wax)  \n\nNumbness in foot - Also a possible nerve issue. The neurologist may recommend an MRI of your spine to make sure nothing is pinched or out of place there. \n\nI’m here for you. I know how frustrating, scary, confusing and hopeless this can all feel. Will you let me know what the neurologist says?",

Your nursing director doesn't have access to all HR records, you'll just muddy the waters putting two resources going to look in opposite directions \n3. If what she may have reported to HR is unsubstantiated, and based off personal statements, does this amount to a degree of slander?   This is a big one.     As a life lesson, a bf doesn't get to decide if her child's father is appropriate to be around the child.   She cannot withhold the child from a parent based on your opinions.    You overstepped by a lot.   Only the courts can decide visitation.   And it's a long expensive process.     Then you got aggressive enough that she threatened to call the cops.    In your own words, this was done via text.    That's not personal statements,  that's actual proof in your own texts.  And fyi, personal statements are acceptable by HR.   It's not a court of law.\n4. Do I have any right to know the reason behind the ineligible status, or am I at the mercy of the hospital to disclose whats on their records?  No.  You actually don't even have a 'right' to know that you are ineligible for rehire. \n5. Is this likely due to the relationship, or as some have said, more likely due to the failed COVID Vaccine submission?  It's not due to the relationship,  it's not due to covid.

    "a": "I have to ask, are you controlled opposition? It almost seems like you are trying to discredit Steve Kirsch. I have tried to [address your complaints previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/vnm8t3/latest_survey_shows_the_covid_vaccines_are_a/iea0dlg/?context=3).\n\n&gt; Some of the findings don't make sense. Of those claiming to be vaccine injured, 54.8% said that they sought medical help for their injury - yet 65.2% claimed to be hospitalized\n\n* Of those claiming to be vaccine injured, there are 42 people (11.11%)  out of 378 who got injected.\n* Of those 42 people, 23 of them (54.8%) sought medical help.\n* Of those 23 people, 15 of them (65.2%) were hospitalized.\n\nThis makes perfect sense when you don't only look at percentages.\n\n&gt; I doubt that many of the respondents understood what a \"household\" is. \n\nMore than 1% of these people responded that they had more than 8 people in their household. As [in previous polls, some of these may be student residences](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/vnm8t3/latest_survey_shows_the_covid_vaccines_are_a/iea0dlg/?context=3) with a large number of people in the household. Without the raw data ([which was available for the June 25 survey](https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/latest-survey-shows-the-covid-vaccines?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email)), you cannot estimate the total number of COVID deaths from these surveys. However, the ratio of vax deaths to COVID deaths should be robust against this problem.\n\n&gt; If there were 5 members in the average American household\n\nThe [average size of a household in the USA is 2.51](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183648/average-size-of-households-in-the-us/). So your \"if statement\" renders your result off by 2X. You sure are looking like controlled opposition here.\n\n&gt; Nice to know that at least 45% of the public is batshit insane and/or suicidal.\n\nAgreed. Of the 523 respondents, 378 received the vaccine and 233 \"would buy again\". That is basically all the people who got boosted, and half of those who got 2 doses. It seems like anyone who has been boosted has fully drunk the Kool-aid and refuses to reconsider their decision. This does not surprise me.\n\nI agree with you that [Steve Kirsch should write about the nitty-gritty of the poll](https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/our-latest-poll-vax-2x-deadlier-than), and allow access to the raw data. I enjoy drilling down into raw data, rather than having someone tell me what the data says. It seems like there [might be a way of accessing raw data](https://www.questionpro.com/a/showResponses.do?mode=execute&amp;questionID=111553455&amp;answerID=597918735&amp;groupingID=9959188&amp;count=233) but you need to sign up, for free(?).",

Get a pet you can both care for before bringing more humans into this world, first see if you can both manage parenting say a puppy or a kitten.

While he may owe you alot more than just money, going to him saying ‘hey I need money’ is a bad idea all around. Unless you’re willing to peruse a relationship with him, willing to contact him beyond simply taking out the anger you feel (justified or not), then it’s best to leave it as it is. While your grandparents have their opinions bc it pains them to see their son suffer, it’s not your job to make them or your dad feel better. I feel for you and your upset is legitimate. But be wary of contacting your dad because of money and anger.\n\nWhat you COULD ask of him in the scenario that your relationship healed enough to be healthy, is to co-sign with you on a bank loan. This means in the event you go AWOL and skip out on your payments, the bank will hold him financially responsible. It’s a big financial ask, but would allow you to take out more than you could on your own.\n\nMy recommendation is to ask someone else to co-sign and/or take out a smaller loan to supplement a COMMUNITY COLLEGE associates degree. It’s is infinitely cheaper, increased opportunity for financial aid, and has a campus that caters to working students. This way you can easily hold a part time job, go to class, have money to pay for tuition and books, have money to pay your bills, money to add to savings, and a little bit left over to play with every month. Then if you want, you can move to larger U for the last two years of a degree. \n\nBest of luck to you, sorry for any typos, I’m on mobile",

    "a": "Most of what people around the world \"know\" about the US is honestly completely and utter BS. Hell, quite a few of you all still believe old British Royalusy propaganda. Yes, from the days of old King Georgie the Thirdie himself. \n\n&gt;Genuinely curious as to why you have to work out how much extra you have to pay when buying something, why not just have the actual price on something like majority of the world?\n\nBecause we can math. \n\n&gt;And why can you not transfer through online banking and how do you not have paywave\n\nSee top paragraph for why this is nonsense. \n\n&gt;And don't even get me started on how the country doesn't have free healthcare as a place with such a thriving economy you'd think that'd be a priority.\n\nDon't worry, we won't hold it against you that you, most of the world, and seemingly 1/3 of our citizens don't understand what limitations on government power are. After all, we know some of you aren't all that bright. I mean most of you didn't stop killing each other because some royalty, or totally not related (yeah, they are) to royalty Prime Ministers, said so just in the 1940's. But to answer your question it's because the pro-government Healthcare folks have such brilliant Constitutional arguments as \"we have to\" and \"everyone else is doing it.\" Which *un*surprisingly doesn't fly as an argument in the Supreme Court. And is hilariously incompetent to the point that the ACA \"arguments\" from the Left **still make me laugh**. \n\n&gt;Also a lot of American citizens seem to be chronically online and are offended over the strangest things. Some will likely be offended by this\n\nNot offended, just tired. If you really are new to Reddit let me tell you this truth. A bunch of these joints believe decades old Soviet propaganda is true, believe the locomotive is the peak of transportation technology, amd that Capitalism is basically anything they dislike even when it's just human nature. Dealing with hearing that day in and day out is annoying at best and saddening at worst. Then you throw on top of that the foreigners who just **have to** point out that since the United States isn't like their country that it's inferior. And then when we defend it *we* are the dangerous nationalists.\n\nI mean imagine everyday an aunt of yours calls you up and tells you that, despite your very well paying job you like, that because you didn't have kids when you were 23 and don't own a three bedroom house that your life is a complete failure. That's what it's like being an American and seeing people like yourself say our entire nation is \"weird.\"",

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (30F) began exploring ethical non monogamy earlier this year. I met 'Matt' (28M) who recently opened his relationship with his long-term partner. I was the first person he went out with. We've hung out over 7–8 months. He keeps a busy calendar, so sometimes it's hard to meet.\n\nAbout a month ago, I booked a comedy gig for tonight as a celebration for meeting a monumental deadline today in my education. I was happy going by myself to celebrate. A few weeks ago, Matt and I talk about meeting up and he tells me his social calendar is again busy, and then he has some friends visiting, and then he's travelling again. He’s keen to see me before he leaves. He’s only free tonight. I tell him about my deadline and the gig and extend the invite. First he’s unsure because he doesn't want to interrupt my set plan but I tell him I'd love for him to join.\n\nAbout a week after Matt books his ticket, he tells me that he didn't realise one of his friends will be staying an extra night. Matt asks if his friend can come along and is very apologetic. Matt and I haven't spent alone time in ages, but this is still better than nothing. A part of me is pleased that Matt wants me to meet his friend, so I say yes. Few days ago, I find out that a woman friend of mine has tickets to the same show, so I ask her if she wants to join, since it's already becoming a group plan. At least Matt and I can still be couple-y in this setting. I message Matt yesterday telling him of this and ask if he and his friend want to grab drinks later. Matt's keen and \\*then\\* tells me his partner Ella (28?F) is fond of the comedian performing tonight and has got a ticket too and she's excited to meet me. Ella and I have never met, and Matt and I have never discussed us meeting. She sounds cool though.\n\nThis is where I might be the AH: I message Matt a few hours later – when I know he's hanging out with friends – that this news has unsettled me. That he should have asked me if I was comfortable meeting Ella. I’m not opposed to meeting her but not on a night of celebrating my achievement because I've never met the partner of someone I'm dating and it'll stress me out when all I want to do is unwind after a hectic month. I tell him it might be better if we go for the show with our own groups.\n\nMatt said he's sorry that I 'feel this way'. He said he didn't realise what a big deal it would be for me. He and Ella are best friends and that's how they behave in groups and it would have been fun hanging out together. He doesn't see how bringing his partner would change the dynamic. He doesn't acknowledge that he should have first discussed this with me or that he's overtaken my plans without consulting me. He’s making me feel as if I'm overreacting and creating issues where there are none, and it's making me feel insane.\n\nAITA and creating issues when I could have just gone and had a fun night with some new interesting people?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Its easy to get into a cycle of those steps and it's very toxic. It seems you want to end things and just don't know how.   \n\n\nFirst make sure you are safe, seems like your bf can get very angry. Perhaps do it over a call or with a friend present if you are worried about his response. Lastly, short but kind is usually the best way. Something like 'I really love that you're taking our relationship more seriously now, but I don't think I can move on from things in the past and I don't think I can continue in this relationship.' As long as he's being respectful I recommend answering any questions he might have before a friendly goodbye. Then make it clear if you want contact/no contact and if you want contact how often.   \n\n\nThis is just my opinion of course, feel free to take or leave what you  want",

The thing about Captain Marvel is that she doesn't need a weapon to fight Thor, whereas Thor needs Mjolnir or Stormbreaker to even stand a chance against Captain Marvel. And I'm curious what exactly the criteria is of who's \"worthy\" coz there seems to be no consistency, it all depends on who the current writer wants to be worthy. But since this will be a battle free of the biases of any writer, I'm gonna go ahead and say she is worthy to hold Mjolnir, and even if she's not, holding her down with the hammer does nothing coz she still has her arms which she can use to shoot her photon blasts. Plus she absorbs energy so if he attacks her with lightning while she's like that, she just absorbs it and it powers her up even more, could she eventually over-power Mjolnir the same way Hela did? Possibly. I just don't see how Thor could defeat her, she either comes out on top or it's a draw.",

On the positive, they are more understanding of the will of being alone and not always wanting to be outgoing. \n\nLatin cultures are a bit better, they tend to say more what's on their mind, and if they're annoyed by something, they tell, usually in a kind friendly \"hey pal, listen\" kind of way. I find this very good since we tend to learn each other's boundaries and bond over knowing what each other need. I'm less social than their standard and they notice it and see me out of the norm, but so far, they've been accepting\n\nWest and East Slavic cultures (as well as many non-Slavic ex-USSR countries like Georgia) do I get along with. They don't get pulled off by my constant poker face and they are more tolerant to talk about the negatives of live just as a normal occurance not worth hidding/run away room. They're blunt and don't sugar-coat things but not in an aggressive way. Any unclarity usually gets dealt with quite fast and they usually open up and show warmth after getting through the outer shell.

    "a": "Your Honour,\n\nI note the additional submissions made by the appellant that the Commonwealth wishes to reply to.\n\nFirst, the appellant's suggestion that the Parliament 'intends to restrict free exercise of religion' may be true, insofar that the withdrawal of a Commonwealth subsidy to non-government schools, some which are religious schools, are likely to lead to increased costs for parents and guardians who wish to send their child to a non-government school.\n\nHowever, a restriction is not a prohibition. As has been made clear, the first step of interpreting the *Constitution* is to consider the text as per the *Engineers Case*. The *Constitution* is clear that the Commonwealth cannot make laws that ***prohibit*** the free exercise of religion.\n\nThe appellant has not demonstrated that the *Act* prohibits the free exercise of religion which is what is required to find the *Act* contrary to s 116 of the *Constitution*. Therefore, this line of argument respectfully leads nowhere.\n\nSecond, the appellant's logic is that s 116 of the *Constitution* covers more than merely the prohibition of free exercise of religion. The argument appears to be based on two factors, the first which is that *religion* has a broad meaning to also encapsulate 'the teaching and propagation of religion', and the second being that US jurisprudence on a similar clause in the *US Constitution* supports an interpretation of the clause in favour of the appellant.\n\nOn the first aspect, the attempt at linking the comments by McTiernan J in the *Jehovah's Witnesses v Commonwealth* has no bearing. The Commonwealth is not agreeing or disagreeing in this instance with the proposed definition made *in obiter*, but assuming for the argument that this was agreed to, just because the word 'religion' encompasses 'the teaching and propagation of religion* by itself does not do anything.\n\nAgain this comes back to the point as made clear above, that is the appellant must show that the Commonwealth has prohibited some activity that is for the free exercise of religion (subject to the further criteria as stated in paragraph 8 of my initial submissions). The appellant has not shown how the Commonwealth via the amendments to the *Act* prohibit non-government religious schools from operating. Therefore whether the definition of 'religion' also included 'the teaching and propagation of religion' does not assist the appellants case.\n\nOn the second aspect, the Court has no reason to consider US jurisprudence because sufficient certainty can be drawn from the decision in both *Jehovah's Witness v Commonwealth* and *Kruger v Commonwealth* about the appropriate interpretation of the free exercise clause in the Australian context. That is, the Commonwealth cannot make laws that have the purpose (and effect) of prohibiting the free exercise of religion. \n\nThe appellant can show the Commonwealth contravened s 116 if they can show that the legislation has that purpose. However as clearly made clear earlier, the legislation has only the purpose of withdrawing funding to all non-government schools. It does not do anything to prohibit religious practice. All the appellant has shown, which we agree with, is that a parent who wishes to send their child to a non-government religious school is likely to have to pay more to do so. Thee appellant has not shown how the *Act* does anything to prohibit them from operating.\n\nIf, despite what we respectfully submit is the clear interpretive method for s 116 of the *Constitution* as done under the *Engineers Case*, their Honours consider it prudent to undertake a comparative law analysis, the reference to US case law  does not assist. The Commonwealth has withdrawn funding to all non-government schools, not just non-government religious schools. That is a completely neutral position and consistent with *Everson*, noting that in this instance the Commonwealth is not making any statement on whether the doctrine of 'neutrality' should be accepted. \n\nIt is also unclear why the citation of *Hoxton Park* assists the appellant. I note that Basten JA (Allsop P and Beazley JA agreeing) [stated](https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/54a6364d3004de94513d9145):\n\n&gt; This conclusion does not require reference to ... the third limb (\"prohibiting the free exercise of any religion\") as relied upon by the applicants.\n\nAs the case did not concern the interpretation of the free exercise clause the citation of this case does not appear to have any merit.\n\nUltimately the appellant has not shown how the *Act* has the intention to prohibit the free exercise of religion. Nor does the *Act* do anything to prohibit the free exercise of religion. The fact that it may become harder for a parent to send their child to a non-government religious school does not equate to prohibition. Thus the Commonwealth respectfully submits that the Court should find that the *Act* does not contravene s 116 of the *Constitution*.\n\n\n****\n\nGeneral Rommel  \nSolicitor General of Australia",

IMHO, that's not really good enough. \n\nIf they think he's a creep or abusive that's one thing but just thinking he's not good enough or \"too different\" for you is a bit ridiculous as that's something you get to decide for yourself.\n\n&gt; We don’t have a lot of similar interests\n\nThis isn't strictly necessary for a healthy relationship and having different hobbies can even be good for both of you.\n\n&gt; we have spoken about our futures and have quite different ideas. I am very career oriented and he simply is not.\n\nThis, however, is pretty strictly necessary for a healthy relationship. You two have to want the same things out of life if you want it to work long term and it sounds like y'all have different ideas about that, which could just mean you guys are ultimately incompatible.\n\nThat said, you guys are pretty young so what you want out of life could easily change in the next several years.

Remember that Harper Lee had an entire book before she ended up coming up with the approach to the narrative that would ultimately produce a classic. \n\nI also think that you should be always looking (even in your sub chapters) for a way INTO the book. Finding the correct way to tell your story is probably the most difficult part of it.\n\nBut anyway, just from your original post I think you are being a little too rigid, since you are worrying about how everything is going to fit together and if I had any advice for you it would be this: to be flexible, but firm.

They were raised to survive and advance themselves because those are the only things that mattered when you went to sleep hungry.\n\nSo their grandparents taught their parents who taught them, and who are trying to pass it along to you.

    "a": "As someone who also struggled with depression, it does take a toll on school. When I started my second or third semester i started to fail some classes. I’m honestly not sure if I didn’t apply myself as much as I should, If the classes were just too hard, If professors just sucked, or if it was my depression preventing me from doing good. Maybe all the above. Whatever it was it made my depression worse and it made me think I was stupid. So I did even try in a lot of my classes. I was like what’s the point in trying and doing things like homework if I’m going to fail anyway. At the end I was taking some of the same classes two or threes times. Which pushed me back A LOT and I felt embarrassed when I didn’t graduate with the rest of my classmates that I started with. I didn’t start turning it around until I got tired of failing. So I decided to see a doctor about it. I was able to get medicine for it which helped me find my “grove” for school. Later, I made a schedule to follow to help me stay on track. I stayed at the library for a couple hours at least every school day and try to do at least one more hour of schoolwork at the dorm. My major was human biology BS and it was super hard but what made it easier was picking the right professor. \n\nThis is what worked for me. But if you don’t like your major, please change it. It’ll make your mental health worse if you’re not happy about it. Try to do research about other majors that maybe interesting to you. You can change your major and if you took enough classes you can probably minor in whatever you’re studying now. \n\nFriends wise you can find different ways to find friends. There’s clubs, events, and other things. If you change majors, you can find friends in your new program. Most of my college friends I meet in my program, my other friends are from a chem class we took together. We all have different majors and it was the only class we had together. but since we sat near each other during lab we started talking about became friends. They’re my main group of friends and we’ve been hanging out for like 7 or 8 years now.",

Then if you _try_ to treat it like a job you get vilified. “How dare you leave at a sensible hour, you’re clearly a lazy teacher”. This will only improve if _everyone_ en masse downs tools and says “this is a job not a lifestyle”. Otherwise those teachers who treat it like a job get shamed.",

    "a": "I'm making an assumption here that your loans are mostly private loans, not federal, because payments on a combination of Stafford and parent plus loans would be around $500 per month on a standard 10 year amortization? \n\nI'm going to speak to you as a mother and grandmother. Both daughters and son inlaws went to community college, followed by local state university, followed by local state university law school, while dorming at home. Three granddaughters and their grooms are on the same path at same schools and started law school two weeks ago and dorming at home. Total tuition, fees, and book cost of the bachelor's degree last May was $30,000 each for all four years. Tuition fees and book cost of each law degree is around $100,000 each for all three years \n\nBefore a person ever thinks about going to law school they should spend a dozen or more full says watching what lawyers do in real life. It is long boring days of reading boring statutes and judicial decisions, followed by more long boring hours of drafting boring documents about boring subjects for boring clients. It is nothing like depicted in movies, tv, or John Grisham novels. Half of all lawyers live to regret having gone to law school. If you don't have a family member or friend if the family that can-do this for you, call around to law firms. You'll speak to lots of ash wholes, but you'll find someone that will do that for you.\n\nOn the comical side is a YouTube video titled \"Don't be a lawyer by crazy ex girlfriends. The ending was funny until two lawyers that practice with my daughters and son in laws had a former law school friend that knew the gal that jumped from the 27th floor to the street below in NYC a few months ago. \n\nAfter determining that yes I do want to be a lawyer, I suggest community college followed by local state university, as others recommended here. And a state university law school rather than a very expensive private university law school. Daughters and son in laws graduated from a bottom 50 of 203 ABA worked  law schools because three were accepted to #50 of 203but one was wait listed. They travel through life together or not at all. That bottom 50 is now ranked #46, the #50 is now ranked #56. Things change over time. \n\nThey have friends that graduated from #50 with a mere $300,000 of debt each, passed the bar exam, and took $40,000 a year high school teaching positions because PSLF made more economic sense than associate positions working 70 hours per week for $60,000 a year. They walk free of debt in 2024. \n\nMy point to you is stop digging a hole until you know for certain that you really want to be a lawyer and start reducing the cost .",

It sounds like you've given too much power to your dad or parents in how to live your adult life. You could have chosen whichever school you actually preferred. Student loans exist for a reason. You CHOSE to listen to your father and then now you blame him for the awful 4hr commute. \n\nAs an adult you were seen having a small tiny innocent private moment with a date. Somehow you allowed your father to take away your clothing and your phone and be put on an even stricter curfew. \n\nBased on your mentioning of ethnic clothes, I am assuming your family has cultural ties to another country so it's probably some type of conservative outfit for modesty? And it doesn't sound like you chose to wear it. \n\nAlso, we don't have to give a pass to someone due to a history of good deeds. The past doesn't condone or excuse current bad behaviour. An extreme example is a priest molesting children. He may have done some good work in the church and with other congregants but does that condone molestation? It doesn't. You know how you can forgive your dad (IF you wanted to)? Is that he apologizes for trying to control you, how he behaved, how he embarrassed you. We do not need to give forgiveness or understanding or compassion to people who don't feel they've done anything wrong. We don't owe people our understanding and kindness. He may have been a good father and done lovely fatherly things but that's what parents are SUPPOSED to do. He doesn't get a gold star for being a decent parent in some ways.",

Whether you’ve said it to his face or not, teens are incredibly perceptive, so he likely knows how you feel. If he’s dealing with “significant trauma” (as you put it), this isn’t about laziness – it’s about an inability to cope. And when your parent regards you as a lazy failure (and projects their own feelings of failure onto you), it inevitably feeds a shame spiral that only worsens the paralysis. It’s a vicious cycle: “I’m a loser” —&gt; “stop acting like a loser” —&gt; “I can’t, because I *am* a loser”. \n\nTrauma can absolutely be overcome with solid coping skills, which most of us aren’t born with. I think that getting into therapy yourself might equip you to better support your son (especially in this crucial time before he turns 18) and might eventually motivate him to seek help himself. \n\nYou clearly love your son and want to see him be well again.

Ask them why they thought that was professional, even if it was outside work. Then talk.\n\nI have a pregnant TA who has spent a lot of time lying on the floor during free play and sitting down during outside time instead of interacting with the children, and she is moodier these days, but we haven't formed a group chat calling her 'Ms Cunt' or talking about how lazy or useless she is, by the way.

The issue being, if you never experience them, you never learn how to handle them.

    "a": "Thanks for sharing your very organized and detailed post! I don't usually respond to these posts, so forgive me if my response is unhelpful or incomplete. I just related a bit to your situation and wanted to process my thoughts.\r  \n\r  \nThere are times when I feel immensely pressured by my family members when they repeatedly tell me to\r shape my life a certain way or work on endeavors they think are best for me. It sucks because like you said, \rI end up harboring resentment and avoid acting on it so as to not hurt, disappoint, or cut off others. I haven't figured out how to best navigate these situations personally, but I generally attempt to take a step back and analyze the situation,\r  \nand see if there are any possible outcomes aside from either neglecting my mental health or hurting family, like you've done. In my most recent similar case, I decided to 'tank the hit'\r  \nand follow my family member's instructions. Even though I harbor negative feelings about it and cannot generate any motivation for it, I concluded that since I currently\r  \nhave the privilege of free time and decent mental health, the cost of complying entirely for them is less than the cost of damaging a relationship. I think your situation is quite a bit harder, since your education and career seem to be at stake.\r  \n\r  \nFor your first option, I agree with your intuition that choosing a new field of study that you are not so interested in\r and starting over from scratch (?) may not be a good choice, since you might run into the same problems. If you have opportunities to\r preview different degrees (i.e talk to other students, sit in on classes, etc.), take them, but I wouldn't commit to a new path I'm not remotely motivated for at the start.\r  \n\r  \nFor the other two options, it sounds like you don't believe you can make it through a 5th year (last year?) of medical school without taking severe hits to your short and long term mental health. If I was completely\r confident in that, I would think it best to take a break to work and recover. If your family is financially secure and you don't need this degree immediately to put food on the table, your mental health is the next priority. \n\nIf you make this decision, it might be helpful to talk to a counselor or advisor at school about it, and if the medical school allows you to return after taking a gap year or two, that's another positive. I can understand your parents with the whole 'sunk-cost' argument, especially with how much mental and emotional effort you've spent on getting this far, but you know your limits best. You still have a lot of life to live, and taking a slightly longer path towards career will be worth it if it can help your depression and give you peace in the long term.\r  \n\r\r  \nI also think it's valid for you to feel resentment, even though your parents might be acting out of love, since your experience their actions as immense pressure and expectations.\r You are being encouraged to pursue education in a way that has been painful, and you are forced to make difficult decisions like this -- it's resentment coming from real hurt and is not something\r you chose and is not something to feel overly guilty for. It sounds like your parents love you, and I hope you are able to express your guilt/resentment and whatever decision you make in a non-offensive way to them or other people you trust.  \n\n\nI'm rooting for you, please take care of yourself whatever you choose.",

    "q": "I'm tired of trying to save my boyfriend",
    "a": "TL;DR: leave. Family patterns will repeat and you will end up taking in an adult child who will treat you with the toxic behaviors his family has treated him with since he has no desire to change. 2 golden rules: 1) Ask yourself, is the current relationship you are in a relationship you want to have for the next 20 years? 2) you set the rules for others to treat you, so don’t let them walk over you or don’t let them in- ESTABLISH AND ENFORCE BOUNDARIES\n\nComing from a thirty year old F who is now divorced and was in a quite similar situation as you, LEAVE. I am now engayged and muuuch happier now :)\n\nWhen I was younger and dumber, I hooked up someone who miraculously had fifty million autoimmune diseases when I was planning on breaking up with them. I had reaaaaalllllly good insurance, and they knew it. I also had a nice savings account built up. Knowing their family, this person was physically, emotionally, and financially abused for coming out as gay when they were younger and I was emotionally abused for coming out so I was too. Heart strings pulled. After many nights of emotional abuse and gaslighting that I didn’t recognize because when you have a big heart you only see good in people and don’t see any 🚩🚩🚩, they finally convinced me to marry them after a few short months. I mean this individual couldn’t possibly care for themselves since they had all these autoimmune conditions, and all the abuse they had as a child. (SARCASM) They were horrible with money and I could teach them how to handle money and eat right and just take care of themselves (because all they ate was ramen and their apartment was like an episode of hoarders). We also agreed that after a year of marriage we would split and no harm no foul.\n\nWelp, did not go that way. Right after the standard courthouse marriage, they immediately changed. A couple weeks in, they me that if I left, they will hunt my family down and kill all of them. I have since them mended things with my family. After leaving college and moving I had repaired my relationship with my family (prior to meeting this person). I had to cut off all contacts with friends and family because I was cheating on this person with anyone I had a conversation too, including my brother who I always said was my best friend. Apparently “siblings should never be that close unless they are f*cking.” Actual quote from my ex. My ex Found access to my bank accounts and used all my money to buy random shit. Since we were married it was legal to do so according to the lawyers. Eventually they started beating me, Then starting buying guns and carrying the 3/4 pistols with them wherever they went and I got used to waking up with loaded pistols against my head and accusations of cheating when I literally did nothing but go to work and back. I stopped my passion of long distance running and gained 40 pounds because I would “look at other girls” during my runs. \n\nFinally, my boss saw me come into work with a black eye and convinced me to report it. I did, and didn’t come home after. Lived on couches for four months with only four t-shirts and 2 sets of scrubs despite working 2 nursing jobs. Some days I slept in my car or an empty office. My ex would call my over 100 times a day and send over 300 texts a day. I was hoping for a clean divorce. She even admitted in the texts to threatening to kill my little brother for accidentally doing something that mad them mad. Eventually I filed a restraining order because she was living in my house I was still paying a mortgage on (thank goodness my mom convinced me not to put her name on it). Ex countered by filing a restraining order on me and pressing false charges. I will still admit I had never laid a hand or physically abused them. This was around Christmas so I spent all Christmas and the week around Christmas I took off cleaning my house that could have been an episode of hoarders. My ex came to my work multiple times accusing my of various things, causing multiple investigations that ended up being false. I lost many scholarships and opportunities. I had to go to court many times for false charges that were dropped, but my favorite would be “[I] burned [them] while [they] were sleeping on the couch with electromagnetic waves through the help of aliens.” That one didn’t go to court but somehow still warranted an phone call/investigation with the police office. Probably because her cousin is on the police force of the small town she’s from. After trying to kill myself 3 times and being admitted 2 times I finally pressed charges on her which finally got her to leave me alone.\n\nI work as an er nurse and it breaks my heart every time I see girls and guys who were younger versions of myself come in for mental health evaluations (mostly for suicidal ideation) because they can’t handle all the stress of learning themselves as a young adult and being fully independent, whilst being in an abusive relationship. (Yes being with an adult toddler is an abusive relationship). Ask yourself, is the current relationship you are in a relationship you want to have for the next 20 years? You have already established the rules on how you want him to treat you so nothing is going to change unfortunately unless you start enforcing boundaries. However. That may cause your relationship to break.",

Take every opportunity you can to attend any events they organise which bring in employers in the sector you’re intending to work in.\n3. Make sure your LinkedIn profile is up to date - profile photo, decent banner image at the top, great description of you (the ‘about’ section) and all career experience and education up to date. Posting content relevant to the field you’re going to enter is a great move, as is engaging with people already working in that field by liking posts, commenting etc.\n4. Twitter. You may not like it, but the Twitter professional community is a powerful way in which LinkedIn content in relevant areas gets amplified. Following key people in your field and reacting to Tweets is a very effective way of getting news about opportunities quickly and often before it’s even gone live on websites.\n\nWhy are 3 and 4 so important? Because recent figures show that 90% of employers say that they are making their best hires through social media.\n\nbut for sure, leverage whatever your university careers department has to offer you - engaging with them is certainly something that could help.",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn’t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like “What is Maoism?” or “Why do Stalinists believe what they do?” will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n**NEW RULE: 7. No chauvinism or settler apologism.

    "a": "My dude, that's a really tough way to be feeling and I'm so sorry you're going through it right now. That's a deep hole and it must be really hard to believe that you'll ever climb out of it; I hope that your plan changes and you can get something more out of your existence here.\n\nThere's a certain application of nihilism - nothing really matters, so what's the point of doing anything? - that's certainly seductive, but it's actually a misapplication of the philosophy: if nothing we do matters in the end, then what we do is *all that matters*. The universe won't care when we're gone, but that one person you gave a sandwich to will care. The person you share your story with and reconsiders their own choices will care. The people in your life who know you and will have a void in their life without you will care. If nothing we build lasts forever, if nothing we learn lasts past our lifetime, if nothing we care about will survive the heat-death of the universe, then all that matters is how we choose to treat each other.\n\nIf you can't justify living for yourself, find purpose in helping others. Volunteer at a soup kitchen, a homeless shelter, a dog rescue/adoption center. There is no meaning in our lives except the meaning we create ourselves - and if you feel meaningless right now, go out and help somebody else. There is no weapon more deadly against feeling like you don't matter than proving that you do - at least to someone.\n\nYour choices are your own. Are you brave enough to stick around and improve this dumpster-fire for yourself and others?",

But I gained curves in my mid 20s and although I love the new boobs and butt I have, I still have that societal belief that thin is attractive especially in European standards considering I’m not European myself, and I’m also battling with family telling me not to gain weight and to remain thin and lose weight because I look unattractive and Europeans love the idea of being thin.",

    "a": "In my opinion, tech will continue to penetrate all aspects of daily life and will never stop. Therefore I believe there will continue to be healthy opportunities for decades to come. 29 is also still young - I consider this to be irrelevant to the career switch - in 30 years time,  you’ll realise that 29 was still just the start of your career, regardless of whether you switch industries. \n\nFor the reasons below, I’d be less worried about whether tech will still have enough opportunity for you, and more concerned about whether you want to spend the time learning and developing yourself throughout your entire career in order to stay relevant, and to keep up with the opportunities.\n\nIt is true that the tech industry is comparatively new in comparison to other industries, and it will no doubt continue to mature over time. However the beauty of tech is that it never stops changing. An ever changing landscape = ever changing opportunities = continuously high demand for skilled people. Right now we’re not training enough people in schools to meet the current demand, let alone future demand.\n\n‘Web development’ in its current form may change over time. For example, the programming languages and frameworks used may change. The way in which we interact with a website may also change… especially as we move increasingly into wearable tech, smart speakers, and are increasingly using artificial intelligence to surface relevant content. The world will then need software engineers to develop what the future looks like.\n\nAs a structural engineer, I assume the end result of your work is currently some sort of physical structure, e.g. a building, a bridge etc. Let’s say Company A builds a bridge. Once the bridge building is complete, it’s then just a case of maintenance. The chances of another company, let’s say Company B, building a competing bridge next to Company A’s bridge is low, and if it did happen, it would likely happen years apart. The barrier to entry is high, and the potential return is likely not worth it. Compare that to tech… if Company A builds a successful, yet simple app, there might be 100 other companies that want a slice of the action. The barrier to entry is low, with potentially high returns (think Snapchat + Instagram stories). All of these competing companies may be able to produce a competing app within weeks. But in order to do so, each company needs developers / software engineers, regardless of whether their competing apps succeed or fail.",

Even those who do likely didn't excel at every competition, or achieve PBs significantly better than cis athletes.\n\nFor example, Lia Thomas (swimmer) took part in several other competition swims in the event featured in the media, but didn't finish in a podium place in any of them. The widely shared photo of her on the podium alone while the other podium finishers were huddled together, some distance away, was widely misinterpreted - they had gathered for a photo op as they'd all previously participated in the Olympics, and were likely also catching up with each other.\n\nTransphobic bans make even less sense with team sports, as anyone dominating the field at the expense of teammates would stick out and likely not be regarded as much of a team player, so would have a decent chance of not making the competition team for being unsporting. It's the cooperation of the team members and the performance of the team as a whole (rather than individual members) that matter.",

In college and grad school I'd just avoid the early classes but with jobs you're a bit more limited. I sought a diagnosis specifically to get accommodations at future jobs. Finding a job is a problem of its own due to ADHD and autism and how generally shitty it is to be a scientist right now. \n\nIn grad school I swore by caffeine. I would get through my morning routine, go to campus early before anyone else, and \"reward\" myself with breakfast and black tea. For whatever reason I was able to stick with that for quite a while but that was a decade ago. \n\nNow, I avoid scheduling things early and if I can't well, I guess I had better plan to have jello brain that day. I'm on ADHD meds and they help to an extent, but if I'm sleep deprived from having to be up earlier than normal it's just miserable. It's like having a pot of coffee after being up for 24 hours. I've got energy and I'm restless, but my brain is totally useless.\n\nIf you've never been evaluated for ADHD and the symptoms sound like what you experience, it's worth seeking a diagnosis so you can get on the right treatment plan. The difference between me a few years ago pre-diagnosis and me today with meds is huge. Still can't work and I still struggle a LOT, but I've got this tool in my proverbial toolbox that, along with coping skills, allow me to reasonably predict how well I can function on any given day. I have a baseline now whereas before it was a complete surprise every day whether or not I'd be able to function.",

Nursing is teamwork so maybe you could work something out with coworkers where they do your needle related things and you take care of something else for them.\n\nIf nursing doesn’t pan out for you, then I wish you the best of luck as a teacher!

A good first step would be to talk to your husband, share your struggles and develop some plans together on how to handle it. It might also be helpful to sit down with your daughter and explain the situation to her. Just so she’s prepared and knows it’s not because of her that you are feeling this way and maybe find some ideas together on how she can help. Depending on how close you are with your family it might also be good to ask for additional support for them. I don’t know how the university system work in your country, but here in the UK everyone usually has a personal tutor, course leader and disability team that they can go to for guidance and assistant so it might be worth it to talk to them and see what support is available. Instead of trying to push through the burnout, it’s important to recognise that you need and deserve a break. So don’t be afraid to take time for yourself. You have been doing great, but even the biggest hero needs a break at times! Sending you lots of love and supportive thoughts",

    "a": "I’m a BTL, early launch store (Aug21). In the beginning there was a ton of support and definitely high expectations for us that were the first to open. Although I’m not a former Sephora employee, I’m a long time Sephora consumer. I have a close friend that is an exec at LVMH (Sephora group) so had a bit more insight. My sm seemed to be 98% clear on all functions, operations, etc. of Sephora. He is very supportive, and for the most part allows me to run my store. We were very fortunate that during pre launch set up ( and for one day post open) we had an individual from a free standing store (operations supervisor) come and work with us. This was a great help. I do not understand why this is not happening at every new store. Many small tips and tricks especially operational- from fixtures/parts, merchandising, signage, etc. And guidance with sales and client experience. Again, every store should receive this type of support. Field trainers are wonderful- Sephora is all about client experience. They work with the team about driving sales and providing that experience, I believe that stores should have field trainers come in every 6-8 weeks for the first 6 months to 1 year. There is a lot of turn over at many stores, (I’ve been fortunate) so this should be pushed more. I’ve been to many S@K stores and see so many ba’s that don’t have “it”. No approach, no connection with a client, no drive to sell or educate. That has to come from training, from the BTL, and the field trainer. I also think that starts with the hiring. In some cases I think it was a mistake to hire internal employees from kohls- some just wanted more $. They had (or have) no understanding of Sephora, skin, hair or mu, no selling skills and no passion. But in some cases it was or is a push just to get people on board. \nOk, so what I’ve observed and learned..\nNew stores ( I’ve helped 3 stores launch since mine and have a private group for outreach and support) are given less time to set up their store - 1 week less. Makes no sense, as it’s confusing as is. And now things are being thrown together and are much more disorganized. Teams are being slapped together, and initial training is being somewhat overlooked. Policies (some were never fully communicated) are inconsistent, or not followed at all. Positions and roles are unclear, as well as general duties for the whole team. Have even heard teams say they “gave up” on setting something correctly because it was a pain. So much inconsistency. Kohls store management is unclear (information is there for them) and some do not care. Headcount and payroll hours have changed- this is not good as it goes against the experience standard. And it leads to greater theft. Some S@K teams are pulled to Kohls- that is wrong and every member of management know this. The whole gift card, returns, and bi look up should have been in place from the start. I’ve been told (per corporate teams) that many things are on the table. Well hurry up please! \nI thought too this would be an awesome opportunity for both stores. It is definitely hit or miss depending on the store. Plus the attitude of the Kohls store about having Sephora there is just appalling. Especially from management- just get over it. And I just wonder where or why some things fell to the wayside. But that is also typical of Kohls. My thoughts for the last few months have been “ I wonder what Sephora really thinks so far”. \n\nI must add, I’m really happy I took this position, I work hard with my team and we really try to provide the best experience for our clients. 💋💄",

LMAOO. TBH either choice is fine. Also perks of taking 3 courses per semester is you can work part time and save up as well. Maybe saving $3k in fees is worth it for you but not everyone can pay $19k a year for fees. We all not rich kids like you buddy. \nWe all got to work while studying. And this is only for domestic students LOL. The only way you are going to save a decent amount of money is if you take more than 5 courses per semester since you are charged program fees.",

However, many teachers go back to school to get a Master's after a couple of years. Long term, getting a Master's is worth it because schools pay you based on how many units you have after your BA/BS. You could get $5k-$10k more per year just because of those units, so if you teach a long time a Master's is definitely worth it.",

    "a": "&gt;What are Sybil accounts in Bitcoin?\n\nNefarious nodes that attempt to disrupt Bitcoin that often lack any bitcoin within. Unlike Miners thousands of these can be spun up very inexpensively. \n\n&gt;I can’t understand how a relay fee can prevent a DDoS attack.\n\nNodes on the bitcoin network peer transactions and blocks with each other. These transactions/blocks need to be validated by each full node independently. Validation requires resources(bandwidth, CPU, RAM, disk) . Sybil nodes attacking their peers could flood the network with many 0 fee or low fee transactions to exhaust legitimate full nodes and cause them to crash or create delays. \n\nUsing a minimum relay fee is just one of many ways Bitcoin prevents hostile attackers using Sybil nodes from disrupting bitcoin with a DOS or DDOS attack. PoW ordering transactions (confirmations) is another way. Full nodes blocking peers with temporary bans if they relay invalid blocks or txs is another method. \n\n&gt;Why does Bitcoin’s transaction fee increase over time and keep other transactions away from been included in a block?\n\nThis is not necessarily the case . Why are you assuming this?\n\n&gt;Is transaction fee = relay fee + mining fee?\n\nThere is only a transaction fee . The minimum \"relay fee\" is a default rule found in most full nodes that enforce the minimum amount a tx fee can be set to for it to be peered by the full nodes. Since tx fees are voluntarily set by the sender in a fee market ecosystem having a minimum rule to peer as a default setting in bitcoin full nodes is one protection against certain attacks . This minimum is sometimes adjusted to better secure the network. Technically you can ignore this minimum relay fee if you are a miner and include a 0 fee tx in a block but this is extremely rare. most txs need at least 1 sat a byte to confirm from miners ((4-8 pennies onchain typically). If you want cheaper txs than you typically do so in a payment channel (free to sub penny txs )",

On top of that you'll most likely need to access a 240V outlet and in an apartment there is probably only one of those for you dryer, if you have one at all. So you could just hang dry your clothes and run the miner instead if you really want to mine. If you have to get an outlet installed you'll have to bring out an electrician which may catch the attention of your landlord. I would not recommend doing it yourself because it's fairly easy to screw it up killing yourself in the process or starting a fire at some point down the line possibly killing yourself and your neighbors at worst or destroying a bunch of property at best. If the wiring is not done properly you also risk destroying the mine, but that's really the least of your worries. The liability you open yourself up to of either being evicted or held civilly/criminally liable for damage to the property and life is pretty big.\n\nAll in all, this is a terrible idea.",

    "a": "Cake Defi is a cryptocurrency finance platform based in Singapore, which uses the Defichain blockchain to offer crypto-backed loans and pays interest and staking rewards  for staking cryptocurrency..\nCake Defi offer a very generous $30 sign-up bonus, paid instantly as DFI (Defichain), for anybody who deposits $50 of crypto on the platform for 30 days. The deposit will need to be allocated to an interest-earning lending batch for 28 days, staked and frozen for 30 days or added to a liquidity mining pool and frozen for 30 days.\nYou can also earn $5 by completing a lesson about Defichain and another $5 for completing a lesson about Bitcoin.\n\nCake Defi is accessable via the website, iOS and Android applications.\n\n**[REFERRAL LINK WITH $30 BONUS](https://cakedefi.com/?ref=884809)**\n\n1. Sign-up to Cake Defi using the referral link to ensure you receive the bonus\n2. Verify your identity using photo ID.\n3. Deposit $50 of cryptocurrency. There is a limited number of supported cryptocurrencies that can be used and some do have high withdrawal fees. I would recommend purchasing DFI from KuCoin/Bittrex as you can easily stake and freeze this for 30 days, earning 25% APY for the duration, and the withdrawal fee is much more reasonable. Alternatively, DASH can be purchased from almost any cryptocurrency exchange and staked for a lower APY.\n   Bitcoin Cash has the next lowest withdrawal fee, followed by Doge and then Litecoin, however these would all need to be frozen in a liquidity mining pool which would require you to buy DFI anyway. I suggest checking the withdrawal fee page before signing up to see which suits you best.\n4. You will receive your sign-up bonus of $30 at the time you freeze for 30 days, or at the end of a 28 day lending batch depending on which you opt for. This will be paid into your account as DFI and will be staked and frozen for 180 days. It does also earn interest during that time, currently around **25% APY!** Go to the freezer section and turn off auto-renew if you will want to withdraw after 180 days.\n5. At the end of your 28 day lending batch or 30 day freeze, your initial deposit can be withdrawn to wherever it was deposited from and if necessary, exchanged to GBP and withdrawn to your bank account. Alternatively, leave it on the platform and enjoy the cashflow. \n6. For the additional $10, go to the 'Learn' section of the website and complete the lessons for Defichain and Bitcoin. This will reward you with another $5 worth of DFI for each completed. Ethereum is showing as 'coming soon' so look out for those in future.\n7. After 180 days, you can withdraw your bonus along with the interest it has accrued.\n\nI have been using Cake Defi for 18 months now and have been impressed with the progress that they have made, but also the progress that Defichain as a whole has made. Both continue to release new features at a steady pace. I have a small amount of staked DFI frozen for a 10 year period to receive boosted  staking rewards and reduced fees.\n\nAside from staking, Cake Defi have other opportunities to earn interest on your crypto using their liquidity pools and via lending. BTC, ETH, BCH, DOGE, LTC and USDT all have good APRs, just keep an eye on the withdrawal fees for BTC, ETH and USDT to ensure you stake enough or for long enough to make it worth your while.\n\n[Referral Reward T&amp;Cs](https://support.cakedefi.com/hc/en-us/categories/900000281146-Referral-Program)\n\n[Platform Fees](https://cake.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035886591-What-is-the-withdrawal-fee-for-Cake-)",

    "q": "Why do folks consider miners \"leveraged\" bitcoin investments?",
    "a": "So you’re essentially being pedantic. Miners are being described as being leveraged bets for essentially the reason you pointed out. If Bitcoin is worth 20k a coin, and costs 10k to mine, miners make 10k per bitcoin. If Bitcoin doubles and goes to 40k miners profits go to 30k, thus outperforming bitcoin. Hence they are called leveraged bets. There are plenty of convoluting factors that’s doesn’t make it a full description of what’s happening, which is what you then focus on to say they aren’t actually leveraged bets. But no, for the most part saying it’s a leveraged bet is a correct description, especially over shorter time periods.\n\nMainly commenting here because if you want to be pedantic, you better not make any mistakes. Like making the mistake of saying:\n\n&gt; Even if it were that simple, this isn't leverage because it tapers off. Raise BTC price another 2x from $40k to $80k and your mining profits only increase 1.75x.\n\nThis is wrong. In the example used, minting cost was 10k. So from 20k to 40k miners profits went from 10k to 30k. If bitcoin then goes from 40k to 80k, miners profits go from 30k to 70k. Last I checked 70k is more than 2x 30k. In fact, this will always be the case, because the profit per coin will always go up the same amount that Bitcoin goes up, but since profit is always less than the bitcoin price, it will always increase by a higher percentage.\n\nTLDR, OP was being pedantic, but fucked something up. Thus needs to be boo’ed, because nobody likes someone who argues about technicalities if they aren’t even technically right in their comments.",

To have a secure chain, you need security to be up all the time. If it's easy to have downtime moments where the chain is unsecured, then the chain is unsecured as a whole. Using unreliable renewable energy surplus is a good thing for the planet, but it's not a good use case security-wise for a cryptocurrency network. \n\nPoW is interesting.

    "q": "Confused about multiple transactions within a block",
    "a": "&gt; each transaction is also checked to make sure the payer has enough funds to send the money\n\nBitcoin does not work like that. There are no accounts in Bitcoin. There are no balances in Bitcoin\n\n&gt; I thought each transaction had its own block\n\nWhy would you think that? It isn't written anywhere  \n\n&gt; I’ve watched the bitcoin video ... but I still don’t get it\n\nWe all learned to read at school. Watching videos makes your brains leak out your ears\n\n---\n\nYou've started in the middle, and become confused. Start at the beginning, with the purpose of Bitcoin, and anchor everything else on that  \n\nThe purpose of Bitcoin is described on the first page of the Satoshi white paper. Centralized payment processing services choose who can participate and choose which transactions are permitted. They are censors. In the meat world, a shopper and merchant can escape the baggage of the centralized payment services by using physical cash currency. Nobody censors those transactions  \n\nFor on-line transactions, physical cash currency is inconvenient. Before Bitcoin, there was no way to avoid transaction censorship for on-line transactions. Bitcoin offers a cash-like payment option with no transaction censorship  \n\nHow does that work? Bitcoin is tens of thousands of computers (Bitcoin nodes) running software for processing transactions. A Bitcoin node is independent, and connected to multiple other nodes. There is no boss, no manager, no controller. To the extent that every node follows the same rules for processing transactions, the Bitcoin node network converges on a common view of Bitcoin's transaction history, even though every node is operated independently. A node receives messages from other nodes, but does not trust any other node. It performs its own verification of the integrity of the transactions  \n\nBitcoin transactions can not be censored because there is no central point for regulators and corrupt politicians to aim their censorship demands. They can threaten Visa's right to operate because Visa is a corporation. Bitcoin nodes are independent of each other, and independent of any central control. A regulator might try to shut down some Bitcoin nodes. Bitcoin keeps working  \n\nWhy blocks? The simple answer is timing. The Bitcoin system is a network of nodes. The speed of light is a constant - nothing takes zero time. If transactions were to be processed instantly, they would be stored in a different order on different nodes. For the network to discover a common view of the transaction history, transaction processing is delayed. Transactions are collected into blocks, and each block is delayed by 10 minutes (average) after the previous block  \n\nThe transaction history is maintained by creating a new block every 10 minutes and passing it from node to node. Every node checks the new block and every transaction in the block  \n\nWhat's mining? Mining is a minor component of Bitcoin. Its role is to create the 10-minute delay between blocks, so that the node network stays synchronized. Mining is a guessing competition. A million or more miners will each collect a few thousand unconfirmed transactions into a candidate block, and brute force a trivial guessing process until one miner wins the race to add his candidate block to the Bitcoin blockchain. The winner sends his block to his neighbor nodes. All the miners begin competing for the next block  \n\nThe guessing competition has an adjustable parameter which determines how hard it is for the mining network to win the race. If the average block time creeps above 10 minutes for a 2016-block period, this parameter is automatically adjusted to make mining easier (or harder if the average drops below 10 minutes)  \n\nSee the ten most recent blocks  \nhttps://blockstream.info/blocks/recent\n\n&gt; let’s assume if no further block is ever found\n\nAssumptions are never correct. The Bitcoin mining guessing game continues forever, because of its automatic adjustment mechanism. It makes one new block every 10 minutes, whether there are 2 million miners or 2 hundred miners",

    "a": "Cake Defi is a cryptocurrency finance platform based in Singapore, which uses the Defichain blockchain to offer crypto-backed loans and pays interest and staking rewards  for staking cryptocurrency..\nCake Defi offer a very generous $30 sign-up bonus, paid instantly as DFI (Defichain), for anybody who deposits $50 of crypto on the platform for 30 days. The deposit will need to be allocated to an interest-earning lending batch for 28 days, staked and frozen for 30 days or added to a liquidity mining pool and frozen for 30 days.\nYou can also earn $5 by completing a lesson about Defichain and another $5 for completing a lesson about Bitcoin.\n\nCake Defi is accessable via the website, iOS and Android applications.\n\n**[REFERRAL LINK WITH $30 BONUS](https://cakedefi.com/?ref=884809)**\n\n1. Sign-up to Cake Defi using the referral link to ensure you receive the bonus\n2. Verify your identity using photo ID.\n3. Deposit $50 of cryptocurrency. There is a limited number of supported cryptocurrencies that can be used and some do have high withdrawal fees. I would recommend purchasing DFI from KuCoin/Bittrex as you can easily stake and freeze this for 30 days, earning 25% APY for the duration, and the withdrawal fee is much more reasonable. Alternatively, DASH can be purchased from almost any cryptocurrency exchange and staked for a lower APY.\n   Bitcoin Cash has the next lowest withdrawal fee, followed by Doge and then Litecoin, however these would all need to be frozen in a liquidity mining pool which would require you to buy DFI anyway. I suggest checking the withdrawal fee page before signing up to see which suits you best.\n4. You will receive your sign-up bonus of $30 at the time you freeze for 30 days, or at the end of a 28 day lending batch depending on which you opt for. This will be paid into your account as DFI and will be staked and frozen for 180 days. It does also earn interest during that time, currently around **25% APY!** Go to the freezer section and turn off auto-renew if you will want to withdraw after 180 days.\n5. At the end of your 28 day lending batch or 30 day freeze, your initial deposit can be withdrawn to wherever it was deposited from and if necessary, exchanged to GBP and withdrawn to your bank account. Alternatively, leave it on the platform and enjoy the cashflow. \n6. For the additional $10, go to the 'Learn' section of the website and complete the lessons for Defichain and Bitcoin. This will reward you with another $5 worth of DFI for each completed. Ethereum is showing as 'coming soon' so look out for those in future.\n7. After 180 days, you can withdraw your bonus along with the interest it has accrued.\n\nI have been using Cake Defi for 18 months now and have been impressed with the progress that they have made, but also the progress that Defichain as a whole has made. Both continue to release new features at a steady pace. I have a small amount of staked DFI frozen for a 10 year period to receive boosted  staking rewards and reduced fees.\n\nAside from staking, Cake Defi have other opportunities to earn interest on your crypto using their liquidity pools and via lending. BTC, ETH, BCH, DOGE, LTC and USDT all have good APRs, just keep an eye on the withdrawal fees for BTC, ETH and USDT to ensure you stake enough or for long enough to make it worth your while.\n\n[Referral Reward T&amp;Cs](https://support.cakedefi.com/hc/en-us/categories/900000281146-Referral-Program)\n\n[Platform Fees](https://cake.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035886591-What-is-the-withdrawal-fee-for-Cake-)",

Proof of work wastes energy on solving math problems (finding the input that produces a specific hash). Proof of stake has a voting system where validators lose their stake when they vote against the majority. It uses less power but it's hard to do in a way that works and doesn't create monopoly and centralization (what already happened with Bitcoin), that's why it took so much time and controversy for most blockchains to be like that.",

    "a": "the chance of a QC intercepting mining is low because that would take millions of qubits to take over the mining operation - HOWEVER, old bitcoin addresses before they started doing hashed public keys (including the old Satoshi addresses) ARE vulnerable to a QC which would only need about 2,300 qubits to run Shor's algorithm to reverse engineer a private key out of an unhashed public key - this would not take down the whole network but losing old wallets with unhashed public keys would certainly undermine confidence and impact price stability, hence this is good reason to not be too overexposed on bitcoin.\n\nLots of misunderstanding here on this thread - some ppl confuse taking over mining operations with reverse engineering private keys, two different things - the former is hard to impossible, yes, but the latter only needs about 2,300 qubits (IBM will have a system of over 4,000 qubits in about 3 years, in 2025) in the case of public keys that are not hashed and there are very many of them. And due to the Taproot update, this means more public keys will be exposed. Very simply, I just need to track transactions and collect public (unhashed) keys and then wait 3 years or so and then rent some time on a quantum computer, and then boom, I can take Satoshi's bitcoin, and there goes your price stability. So this is a serious - not an existential - but still a serious problem so this means bitcoin needs to start working on post-quantum encryption now, not 3 years from now when these machines with ability to run Shor's algorithm will be operational.",

The first 2 miners came online in May, but in their Texas 1 facility rather than Nebraska.  The other 2 miners were deployed to Missouri in June.  I was not consulted at all about the deployment to other locations instead of Nebraska.  It is now late August 2022 and Texas 1 has been offline for most of the summer due to power curtailment.  One of my miners in Missouri has been offline for 5 weeks.  Why?  I have no idea and neither does Compass.  I have contacted their customer support multiple times regarding this through email and every time, they say they will contact the facility to look into it -- then, I never hear anything further.  So basically, only 1 of my 4 miners is operational at this point.  I have tried to call them as well, but nobody seems to answer the phones there these days.  Dealing with Compass is just an exercise in frustration; you are better off simply buying bitcoin instead of mining it.",

    "a": "You are introducing people to a volatile, high risk market that's become notorious for scamming people (especially those who aren't that knowledgeable about crypto) in a sub called passive income, a place frequented by people without a lot of disposable cash. \n\nI don't hate crypto, I own some myself, and I know it's not inherently a scam, but it is full of scams, and you're encouraging people who generally aren't well-off financially to use it as an income source. Even if you were the first person in human history to devise a reliable, low risk method to make money from crypto, it's still irresponsible to present crypto to people in this way. It is NOT a reliable, regular source of income and as a general rule of thumb, if someone tries telling you otherwise, they're probably benefiting from that in one way or another. Crypto is volatile, unregulated, and much of the mainstream media attention it has received in recent years has been because of rugpulls or someone pooling their life savings into Bitcoin because they were led to believe it would be easy money.\n\nIf you genuinely want to learn about cryptocurrency then fantastic, but don't do it off the back of a post that presents it as a reliable income source, but it's not. \n\nAlso, if someone found a way to reliably make this much money per day, and that's without the option of staking your gains to earn even more later on, they wouldn't be making giant posts in passive income subs to share the love, would they?",

If we can delete a bunch of pointless pencil pushers from the program we'll be better off. And this is where we hit your point on hypocrisy. It seems to me that our civilization is built upon hypocrisy. We live in an upside down world. Recall Orwell's \"Ministries\" in 1984 in the context of law as applied by governments within civilization. Hypocrisy is the norm. It's no wonder that we live in a zero trust milieu. So, as wasteful, ignoble, and dehumanizing as blockchain is, it's a natural outgrowth of a civilization that has been sick since the first formalized hierarchy it was built upon.

Containers, ZFS support with plugins in place.

You could look at StarWind SAN &amp; NAS https://www.starwindsoftware.com/san-and-nas - preconfigured VM with native ZFS support, just for storage. \n\n&gt;What do you think of these options, or something else? Is 1x 8TB with cloud backup a reasonable option, or it's better to run 2x 4TB?\n\nIt depends on what you are after: capacity or redundancy. 2x 4 TB in RAID 0 will not grant local redundancy, also, I assume it to be even less stable then a single 8TB Check on RAID levels (https://www.arcserve.com/blog/understanding-raid-performance-various-levels)",

Turns out this career is one of the most in demand professions in the world today, hundred percent viable, lucrative, no matter what, you can always benefit from it. It allows you to work from home, be your own boss, manage your own work hours, and the income is great! Like, really great. You don't need any diploma or degree. In terms of skills, there are many types of digital marketing careers to choose from - if you are in to art or web design and writing, or if you would prefer talking to clients.

I wouldn’t suggest taking the $2000 course unless you’ve really got $2000 to spare.\n\nNote: try your best to wait for a time Udemy has a sale. Otherwise the course can be pretty pricy. If anything, you can typically buy the course in incognito mode and add it to your account. Most of the reputable instructors also have practice tests on Udemy as well for the SysOps exam.\n\nWhen it comes to steps in which exams to take, any of the Associate ones are fine but it’s also normal to take the Solutions Architect Associate one first. It is the one that is most like the CCP exam in that it covers all areas of the AWS ecosystem in a general sense but adds a deeper level of connection between them.",

    "a": "I can't speak to the Toronto market since I don't live there. See my username. \n\ntl;dr - if you like coding, choose DevOps. If you like statistics, math, and presentations, choose data science.\n\nData Science: This term is not well defined and seems to mean different things at different companies. In aggregate, it is typically closer to business analytics than engineering. Data scientists apply various data modelling techniques to extract conclusions from the data. For example, which holidays generate more revenue for the company. If we use this wording vs. that wording, does it lead to better sales? What is our customer retention rate and is it affected by various factors? The reports are packaged and presented to the decision makers such as the C-suite and product managers. Salary isn't as high as DevOps, but the workload probably isn't as high as well. Seems to be more competitive than DevOps as a lot of folks from academia wanting a leg in tech gravitate towards data science.\n\nDevOps: The advantage of this specialization is high pay at the cost of high stress. DevOps is one of the best paying specialties because of its sheer impact on the company. You maintain the infrastructure and automation that powers the company's applications. Consequently, you are responsible for its uptime. Part of why your pay is so high is because of on-call expectations. The other part is that a few DevOps engineers can manage what used to take teams of engineers to manage thanks to better tooling and cloud infrastructure. You can't go wrong with cloud/devops/sre engineering.",

    "a": "The easiest path is through Docker. Every service is in it's own container, not interfering with the host OS or other services. It adds security, yes. But it's not the main reason behind its popularity.\n\nDocker containers are easy to work with, compared to conventional setups. Since you are dealing with ephemeral containers, most problems can be fixed by recreating the container, or changing the image version/source. If that doesn't help, maybe the problem is in the persistent volumes that were left behind. Most of my troubleshooting boils down to these things. Either way, you can retry setting up the container from scratch many many many many times, compared conventional installs. Without worrying about borking the host OS or other services. Managing services is easy, migrating everything to a new machine is incredibly easy too. Not to mention the huge ecosystem that has sprung up around Docker in recent years. You can find almost anything you need. These are the reasons I use it.\n\nHardware-wise, you have everything you need. Maybe a bit more storage is needed but that's up to your needs. Your processor is Skylake, which IMO is the minimum for reliable transcoding these days. And yes, it will be enough. [Here is a chart of what it can do.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Quick_Sync_Video#Hardware_decoding_and_encoding)\n\nSince this is a bare metal install (the OS is installed directly, without an underlying hypervisor), I would put some sort of WebUI for OS management. I like Cockpit because it gives you a lot of info at a glance and can be set up easily. It also has nice to have modules via 3rd parties like 45Drives' SMB/NFS shares module and so on. Everything else can be run into docker containers - Jellyfin, Nextcloud, VPN for remote access. For docker management, you can use Portainer - it's a containerized services for managing Docker and other containers.\n\nOnce you get familiar with the terminal, you will drop to it more often than using the WebUIs but as a beginner, they are useful.",

    "a": "So by my thinking cloud is really more a path for growth and money and cybersecurity it really more for passion because you just love the field.  But before you decided, be aware of\n\n**The Economics of Cybersecurity**\r  \n\r  \nThink about this, at most companied where  they are just building out their infosec team and bringing people in, they're buying new equipment, spending budget etc. What is the definition of success? If you do everything perfectly, nothing happens. Business operations are normal, there are no CSIRT incidents. So at the end of the year when the CISO or whoever goes for a bigger budget, they say what did you do this year? CISO says, it was a great year, nothing happened!\r  \n\r  \nSee the problem? At most companies infosec is a cost center. That means that you, your team and your whole operation costs the company a bundle of money and generates no revenue. Most non-IT execs can't stand this, it drive them bonkers because all of their success metrics are the opposite, they think wins are things that the company does to make money. This is why the higher you go in cybersecurity for the really big salaries the more likely it will be that you end up working in defense, finance or healthcare because all of those industries have some sort of federal regulations that require a certain level of information and privacy security. They literally can't run the business without it!\r  \n\r  \nNow let's take a look at cloud. Your company has a business or is an MSP for businesses that they need to maintain on the internet 24/7.  As a cloud SRE you make your company money by helping your customer achieve that. You are bringing home the bacon! See the difference? When times get lean it doesn't make sense for the company to RIF you, you're making them money and actively contributing to the company's success. This is a big deal because as long as you don't fuck up you get to be a winner all the time. \r  \n\r  \nBut it's your call.\n\nCheck out this post for a great cloud roadmap, I asked my cloud architect friend at NASA to confirm and he agrees 100%\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/xa87x9/sys\\_admin\\_to\\_cloud\\_possible",

It doesn't go very in depth in any of its blocks, but instead gives a taster of networking, online collaboration, design, cryptography, and future of IT. It isn't a technical module. One of the assignments involved writing a letter to a politician, and another big part is a group project on a WordPress site. Not bad stuff, but it was the weaker level 2 module for me in terms of educational value from my experience, others may find it has more to offer them. \n\nNot sure what you should do instead mind, but I would probably do TT284 in your situation. The technical stuff sounds like it will be a cakewalk for you but 50% of the work is project reports justifying your work and decisions. Not bad.\n\nJust started level 3 but TM351 so far is excellent, the module materials are great and the work seems quite interesting but waiting for access to see the assignments, but I had heard good stuff about this module online which really influenced my decision to take it. I am also doing TM358 (so far so good) and TM354, which involved the least practical work out of the three, but it is also good. \n\nJust a final note, I am a software engineer for a couple of years and worked in IT for a couple of years before that.

Sure you could develop something if you know enough about programming, but as for applicability for forensic work, honestly it would have to be validated and probably wouldn’t have a ton of use.\n\nSooner you should look into the tools used by attorneys as they need to sort through massive files in a comprehensive way.

They have a ton of videos, just pick the stuff pertinent to the class n you will do just fine.\n\n- Networks: that’s the N+ exam, again Udemy Mike Meyers but that class is a bit dense with information and depends on whether you have IT background or not will determine the time. I suggest you don’t rush it n take your time with this one. Get a book if you have to.\n\nIntroduction to Cryptography: Just read the study material, and do some youtube research regarding some cryptographic concepts and algorithms, I follow a channel called [computerphile](https://youtube.com/user/Computerphile) , it’s a very technical channel and you will find a lot of material related to that particular course over there, but I would also suggest further research if you don’t feel familiar enough with the concepts.\n\nThe last two data classes, I don remember how I passed them but nothing to write home about. I guess just read the course work, if you aren’t familiar with basic Sql stuff, again WGU udemy is your best friend, start a class about sql basics, for example [sql bootcamp](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/) - I did that class and it was definitely an overkill but I wanted to learn so I went on with it.\n\nGoodluck!",

You have the power of choice here. Jobs will list tons of skills they \"want\" but you dont have to check every box, though you will check more than a lot of the competition.\n\nSo GL you got this m8",

    "q": "1 vCore, 2 vCores, 3 vCores - can you compare vCore numbers between different cloud/server companies? And some additional questions...",
    "a": "Historically this is how cloud providers calculate number of vCPUs.\n\n(Threads x Cores) x Physical CPU = Number vCPU  \nThe above formula is based on XEONs running at 2 GHz.\n\nSome cloud providers will normalize the vCPU calculation based on speed and average use as well. Let's take a R740XD with 2 Gold 6138 CPUs as an example.  It's base frequency is 2.00 GHz but will run 24/7 at 3.7GHz. The 6138 has 20 cores and 2 threads per core. The Dell R740XD has two 6138s.\n\n2x20x2=80 vCPUs at 3.7  \n80/2.00x3.7=148 vCPUs @ 2.00 GHz speed\n\nSome providers only guarantee 80% use of said vCPU which is a fancy way of saying there are skimming 20% off the top for \"overhead\". In reallity that upscales the 148 vCPU to 177 vCPUs.\n\nYou need to read the TOS for the service to see how \"boost\" works on the plan. You need to read to see if you are getting both logical and physic threads or just logical.  You want to find out if any affinity is used so you're getting the same cores and taking advantage of the CPUs cache(s) or not.\n\nAs you can the vCPU count can be calculated many different ways and more or less is only good for rough comparison across that providers platform. Besides CPU you need to consider IO from storage as well.  Getting a 240GB SSD doesn't equate the same as installing one in your physical machine as they too are often bandwidth limited and not a true SSD but is carved from an SSD pool on the machine or rack/campus.\n\nThe only way to compare different providers or same provider/different platforms is to actually benchmark them!\n\nIf you want to get a rough idea how different components compare between the mainline providers grab a copy of these:  \nhttps://www.cockroachlabs.com/guides/2021-cloud-report/  \nhttps://www.itproportal.com/news/google-cloud-has-the-best-performing-cloud-but-aws-the-most-cost-efficient/  \nhttps://akbu.medium.com/aws-s3-vs-google-cloud-vs-azure-cloud-storage-performance-ea01afae9a6b  \nhttps://www.bmc.com/blogs/aws-vs-azure-vs-google-cloud-platforms/  \nhttps://sam-solutions.us/aws-vs-azure-v-s-google-cloud-which-is-better/",

    "a": "No, the interest rate hikes are not the solution the Fed needs, they just don't have the tools to address this issue.   \n\n\nThe Government does though, and they're frankly doing nothing with respect to policy. A bunch of wet blanket retards are in office on both sides. I've never seen something as disappointing as watching congress try to debate ANY topic.  There are maybe 5% of the reps saying something that is on-topic, and all of the other reps take their moment at the mic to really show Americans just how stupid they are by being completely unable to even follow the goddamn subject they're debating.   \n\n\nThe senate is better, but that's just a bunch of rich talking heads that say one thing and do another.   \n\n\nNot that Canadian politicians are better, they all just follow the American approach and that's why Canada is stuck in the same boat. Worse actually, our housing never corrected like it did in the US. We have tent cities now in major cities, and people would rather blame the homeless that can't afford $2.5k rent per month + food instead of looking at the Gov which is literally floundering in it's inability to make any sort of policy that supports the economy and reduces prices.   \n\n\nIt's sick.   \n\n\nPrimary cause of the misery in Canada are landlords and politicians whom all seem to be landlords.   \n\n\nI hope AMD demand remains strong as it should but this recession is still growing.   \nI wonder though that if Putin does end the war if the pressure would suddenly vanish.   \n\n\nAnyway the left are killing the economy (cause they think it's a rich persons thing) out of ideology because they think the economy is the enemy of climate (it never seems occurred to them at the economy is the people). And the right... they're not even attempting to argue any sort of solutions, it's all about hate and vitriol on that side. The mainstream liberal financial conservative voters are stuck picking between an extreme left and an extreme right government, neither of which look to be suited to address an economic problem.",

    "q": "How has cloud computing benefited humanity?",
    "a": "Good question! \"Cloud computing\" has benefited a lot of businesses, large and small, in their perennial goal to make more money, but as far as benefiting *humanity* goes I can't think of any examples.\n\nThe reason you're \"not quite sure on what cloud computing actually is\" is because *nobody* is. As the saying goes, there is no cloud, it's just somebody else's computer. Now using somebody else's computer is nothing new. Commercial web hosting has been around since the 1990s and hosting for other services probably goes back further still.\n\nIn my opinion if \"cloud\" means anything it's not a technology but a business approach. Paying as you go for what you use, and having the ability to rapidly grow or shrink capacity as needed. Technologies associated with \"cloud\" often act to support this. By contrast with traditional hosting you would pay to have certain hardware and software and you were probably entering into a somewhat long term contract. If you didn't need all the performance you still paid. If it wasn't enough performance your service would be overloaded and expanding capacity would be a lot of work.\n\nBut even this is blurred somewhat. Many \"cloud\" services have now gone towards annual lock-in contracts, and might place other obstacles in the way of expanding. For example with Microsoft 365 the cheaper plans are for small businesses only; if you grow to more than 300 users you need to swap them all to more expensive licenses. It's not *that* hard but it's still an extra task.",

    "a": "if you are just getting into the IT world I would learn the basics first, focus on the A+ and possibly the Network+ (if thats a thing anymore) and try to focus on that.\n\nGetting into DevOps for a tier 1 position is a bit overkill, devops being AWS, AZURE, so on. Im not saying dont learn it, but its best to get a foundational knowledge of IT infrastructure and systems first before diving into that.\n\nITSM is a good thing to learn, service management is very much a help desk responsibility and critical to that role, so id say thats something to invest time into.\n\nGetting into the server space is fine, but if you are at a point where \"im not sure what im doing\", this is where its ideal to get a foundational knowledge of IT first and work with a senior IT staff member to learn more advanced operations and technologies.\n\nI can say from my experience anything you do in a non-professional setting doesnt really sell during an interview or on a CV. Its cool to dabble and learn at home and enhance your skill set, but employers want to see that you have the professional experience to back it up and were able to put those skills into use in an actual environment.\n\nim not sure about the UK since im US based, but do you have the equivalent to an associates degree or community colleges there? I know some actual courses in a structured environment would go a long way, even if there are extended educations courses, might want to look into those.\n\nMy response isnt meant to discourage you because its obvious youre trying and wanting to learn as much as you can, and I commend you for that. But this is just what ive noticed during my time in IT.",

    "a": "If you can come out of college with a certification, that could get you in the door with a junior cloud engineer position.  And I would look for wfh jobs to begin with, if you do have health issues.  There are plenty of companies out there, looking for cloud engineers.  Even as a junior engineer, you'll be making plenty of money.  I don't see many internships with these types of positions, but I'm sure they are out there.\n\nAlso, sign up for a free Azure account and start playing around.  They give you some credits to begin with and you can get some services free for 12 months.\n\nIf you are not looking to get into an IT department, but go straight to the cloud, I'd avoid helpdesk at all costs.  Helpdesk is like a tar pit.  I'm sure you've seen those cartoons/videos of animals trying to get out of tar.  It's almost impossible.  Helpdesk is the same way.  Unless you leave a company (or stay there for many many years), you'll always be called upon to help people with level 1 stuff.  \n\nLastly, make yourself a LinkedIn page, if you don't already have one.  I've found several positions from recruiters reaching out to me, just based on what I have on my LinkedIn profile.  If you have a cert, that will open doors on LinkedIn alone.  Recruiters search for those types of 'key words.'",

    "q": "Windows 95 and Cloud Computing",
    "a": "&gt; Suppose I have an old Windows 95 computer - and suppose I have an movie saved as an MP4 file, and this movie is stored on a cloud computing service such as Microsoft Azure.\n\n&gt; Does this mean that if I were able to log on to Azure from my Windows 95 computer - I would be able to watch this movie without significant lag?\n\nNot really, no. Cloud computing might help in some cases but that requires more from the cloud computing platform than just storing the file. In any case, it wouldn't be enough to allow a grossly underpowered computer to play high-resolution video it would otherwise be incapable of playing.\n\nThere are two components to video playback performance here (or probably more, but two that are relevant here). One is getting the (compressed) video data transmitted to your computer's memory, and the other one is decoding and rendering the video once it has been received.\n\nIf the video file is stored in a cloud service, that *might* improve data transfer speed from the server to your computer compared to getting the data from a single server. It might, at least in theory, be even faster than reading the video from a slow local disk on your computer, although that would require a fast connection and a slow disk. However, the transfer speed would in many cases be bottlenecked by your own home/school/whatever internet connection speed, not by the server that's sending the data, cloud or otherwise. If the bottleneck is at your end, any increased bandwidth potential at the server or cloud service provider doesn't really matter.\n\nThe second component is processing and rendering the video (or HTML page, or whatever). This takes place on your computer. If that computer is a 90's Windows 95 PC, it's not going to have the processing power for decoding or rendering high-resolution MPEG-4 video at real time. A good modern internet connection can get the data to that computer faster than it could decode or render the video. The bottleneck is at your computer, and having the video file stored in a cloud service does not change that. The same would be true of a HTML page that's complex enough that your computer struggles at rendering it.\n\nThe same would apply, although perhaps to a lesser extent, to a more recent but low-powered computer struggling to render a high-resolution video or a highly complex web page. The bottleneck is not in network transmission but in the processing of the received data.\n\nIn fact, all modern video streaming services use highly distributed content distribution networks. You can effectively consider the video that's being streamed to you from YouTube or Netflix to be sent from cloud storage. That doesn't make the job of processing the video at your end any easier for your computer if it's underpowered.\n\nThere is one way in which getting the video from a cloud service could, in theory, help an underpowered computer play video or display other content that it otherwise couldn't fluently process. That would be if the cloud service, in addition to storing the file, also pre-processed the video or other data so that it would be more lightweight for your receiving computer to process. In theory, that could mean for example decoding the compressed video already at the cloud service and then sending *uncompressed*, raw video to your client computer, vastly increasing network bandwidth requirements and network load but saving your computer the trouble of having to decode the video. Or, in case of a complex HTML file that takes significant processing power to render, the cloud service could in theory pre-render the map into an image for your computer, and as you scrolled the map, it would just keep sending more of the map as prerendered plain image data rather than leaving it to your computer to render the image from HTML and geographical information.\n\nSending prerendered images -- or, heaven forbid, raw uncompressed video -- over the network would massively increase network bandwidth consumption, though, and no cloud service probably does that. It would also require more active participation from the cloud service than just storing the file.\n\nIt also still wouldn't allow a 90's computer to fluently render high-resolution video. Not only would such an old computer lack the processing power to even *display* high-resolution video at real time even if the raw video data were handed to it on a silver platter, it likely wouldn't be able to receive the data over its network interface fast enough to receive raw video data in real time, no matter how fast the hypothetical cloud service were to send it.\n\nThe question is not entirely moot, though. Cloud gaming services such as GeForce Now or Google Stadia essentially run the games you play and render their graphics on their servers, and stream the rendered graphics to your computer as (compressed) video. Decompressing video is less computationally intensive than rendering the graphics, so by moving the burden of graphics rendering to their servers and only sending the results to your computer as video, they allow playing more demanding games than your computer would be capable of on its own. That's, in a way, a less extreme form of preprocessing the data in the cloud and sending raw data to your computer only for displaying.",

    "a": "Many things to say. First off, the \"timing\" of events is a problem in and out of itself, it sounds like a confirmation bias, seeing patterns where there are none. A bit like a temporal cherry picking, chosing only infos that confirm your theory.\n\nThe Vatican is not a reliable source, known to skew documents (ever heard of palimpsests ?), shamelessly lie (hidding pedos), censor opposing views (the index or what happened to Giordano Bruno), not let access to the scientific community of their material (keeping the Torino shrine away after studies have been done that contradict their views) and many others...\n\nAside from that, as surprising as it may come from someone like me, the intentions you present in the introduction are laudable and open to diverging views, i like that a lot.\n\nIn the first part about evolution, panspermia and paleocontact, you make a few blunders : \n\nThe works you quote let the door open to panspermia but do not establish it with certainty at all, keeping it as a mere hypothesis (btw, only Hawking talks about it directly).\n\nThe two studies you quote aren't talking about leaps in human genetic makeup, but about gene duplication which occur naturally in many species at moments of genetic mutation, moments that can take hundred of thousands to million of years. There's a reason why the authors talk about those coinciding with species evolution moments (in the first paper, at the time of separation of humans from other primates, in the second, at the time of separation of the genre homo from the genre australopithecus).\n\nThe video you show is just the announcement of the sequencing of the human genome in 2000, which, mind you, is a project started in 1990 and still ongoing, and it just finished a gapless assembly this year btw.\n\nYour article about the pay of the NIH chief is... questionable, not for him, for you.\n\nOnce again you see logical links and patterns where there are none.\n\nThe ancient texts you quote are not considered as historical by the community of historians for a reason. They are highly unreliable. And even for the massive flood event, the fact that many (but not all, far from it) talk about it point to a natural phenomenon, not to a supernatural one. You're the one making that leap.\n\nThe fact that you put NATO, the IMF, the coronavirus, Crispr in there just shows even more that your pattern detecting sense is on the loose. Pure confirmation bias. \n\nAll the guys you quote after are in the same vein.\n\nAnd to answer to the title of your post : In ictu oculi.",

Remember that with automatic scaling, the instances (computing power) for an instance class automatically adjusts to meet your demands.\n\nIf you really wish to mitigate warm-ups, you can set the min\\_instances or min\\_idle\\_instance to 1. But since your App is going to be used by thousands of people at work, I don't think it would be a big deal i.e. ONLY one person out of thousands will notice this lag (if any) early in the morning after which the App will basically always be on because thousands are now accessing it.",

Get a Degree. Ideal if related but it's okay if it isn't.\n\n2. Get a Cloud-related internship (If you can get this you're basically set in the career path) while in college.\n\n2b. If you are unable to do that, find an IT-related job. SysAdmin is ideal but anything really just to show you have experience within IT\n\n3. While working your internship/job, get Certs + learn Terraform outside of work hours. IT is **always always always** upskilling yourself.\n\n4. After certs/Terraform, create Cloud projects **in Terraform** to put onto your resume. \n\nIf you have experience in IT + Certs and Projects and a related degree, it'll be really easy for you to transition into Cloud. If you have a Degree but no experience, **get experience** right now while studying for Certs. Basically, all Cloud jobs will want you to have a good foundation in Networking, VPC, etc so have at least a basic level of understanding of that. Linux is extremely good to know the basics too.\n\nThis can vary depending on where in Cloud you want to go too (DevOps different path from Infrastructure Engineer, Cybersecurity different from TAM, etc) \n\nAlso personal opinion, but I would focus AWS or GCP not Azure. They're both far more intuitive than Azure, AWS more marketable, and GCP is most intuitive (imo)",

    "a": "While people in the replies are generally correct, there is no clear definition of a DevOps role. You should probably get into IT first. Some people understand DevOps as a SysAdmin who manages infrastructure with code, while others have the impression that DevOps (or DevOps engineer) is not a role at all and more about culture. I think everyone is equally true, in the real-world, everyone is doing their own definition of DevOps, it generally means having continuously-delivered distributed software applications (e.g. large-scale web applications or IoT fleets).  \n\n\nI personally see a DevOps engineer as someone who has both a software development and systems administration background. You have to understand how system administration works and all the infrastructure basics and also how the software development lifecycle works and how software teams operate.  Your team will rely on your expertise to properly design and operate applications in the cloud in a cost-efficient and secure manner. You will need to develop a deep understanding of best-practices too, so you know you are implementing everything properly.  \n\n\nIn most companies, you will typically create and maintain infrastructure and automate all stages of the software delivery lifecycle. You ensure that the infrastructure runs smoothly and that software teams can effortlessly and frequently deploy. In extended scenarios you will also have coordination, project management and software architecture responsibilities.  \n\n\nI think unless you have a very extensive background in IT, besides having graduated in mechanical engineering, you will be best off to first start off with a developer role, then slowly transition into the cloud/infrastructure side of things. Learn how to deploy your own applications on any of the major cloud providers, see what kind of technologies they offer to help you (and your potential team) to build your applications.  \n\n\nYou will definitely also need to acquire some systems administration skills, so you have a feel of what is happening in the background, what underlying technologies are used. Many of the cloud providers offer everything you would usually find in a traditional datacenter, the advantage is, that everything can be easily managed as code and you don't have to worry about the bare-metal servers and issues like changing harddrives, installing cables, replacing power supplies etc, but you will still need to design networks, set up VPC peerings and VPN connections, setting up firewalls, load balancing, redundancy, backups (and restore tests aka disaster recovery) etc.  \n\n\nIt will definitely aid, if you look for roles in web development, because it's natural to use many of the AWS services for web-based applications. In buzzwords learn about react, serverless, CDNs, microservices, maybe throw in some machine learning and mobile development.",

Weekly work placement logs are easy to write but the final report at the end of the placement is 4k words long.\n\nIf you have a family especially a young family while doing this course it may be difficult to spend quality time with them but having programming experience will allow to spend less time viewing pre recorded videos looking at basic Fundamental stuff. Hope this helps",

Example below:\n\nA video explaining taking a derivative of a function:\n\nFirst line like this -&gt; \"I am going to show you how to take a derivative of a quadratic function\"\n\nAnd then cut to a top down function.\n\nWith education, specifically for exams, having a clear and organized video will be very helpful.",

    "q": "Doesn't outsourcing/offshoring support lead to information being sent overseas?",
    "a": "Not always. In some cases, it can actually lead to an increase in information being sent overseas. For example, if a company outsources its call centre services to a foreign country, the customer service representatives in that call centre will likely be handling customer inquiries from people in that foreign country. As a result, the company can benefit from having customer service representatives who are native speakers of the language of the customers they are serving.\r  \nIn other cases, outsourcing can lead to a decrease in information being sent overseas. For example, if a company outsources its manufacturing operations to a foreign country, the company may no longer have to send engineers and other employees to the manufacturing facility to oversee production. Instead, the company can rely on the manufacturer to handle all aspects of production, which can lead to a decrease in the amount of information that needs to be sent overseas.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, whether or not [outsourcing](https://medium.com/@maevisjames/why-the-philippines-is-one-of-the-best-locations-for-outsourcing-services-dd6891ae4905) leads to an increase or decrease in information being sent overseas depends on the specific details of the outsourcing arrangement.",
